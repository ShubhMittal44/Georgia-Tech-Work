BUSINESS:\n\n    International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the\nState of New York on June 15, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.\n(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating\nMachine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. In 1924,\nC-T-R adopted the name International Business Machines Corporation.\n\n    IBM uses advanced information technology to provide customer solutions. The\ncompany operates primarily in a single industry using several segments that\ncreate value by offering a variety of solutions that include, either singularly\nor in some combination, technologies, systems, products, services, software and\nfinancing.\n\n    Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise three hardware\nproduct segments--Technology, Personal Systems and Enterprise Systems; a Global\nServices segment; a Software segment; a Global Financing segment and an\nEnterprise Investments segment. The segments are determined based on several\nfactors, including customer base, homogeneity of products, technology and\ndelivery channels.\n\n    IBM offers its products through its global sales and distribution\norganizations. The sales and distribution organizations have both a geographic\nfocus (in the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa, and Asia Pacific) and a\nspecialized and global industry focus. In addition, these organizations include\na global sales and distribution effort devoted exclusively to small and medium\nbusinesses. IBM also offers its products and services through a variety of\nthird-party business partners, including distributors and resellers, as well as\nthrough its on-line channels.\n\n    While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are\nimportant to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially\ndependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of\npatents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which\nvary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM\nhave been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions.\nThese protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing\nproducts and services similar to or duplicative of the company's nor can there\nbe any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation\nor improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances\nthat IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the\nfuture.\n\n    IBM's businesses employ a wide variety of components, supplies and raw\nmaterials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of\nthe company's businesses rely on a single or limited number of suppliers,\nalthough the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are\navailable if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver\ncomponents, supplies and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely\nmanner could adversely affect the company's business. The company's Technology\nsegment results were affected by supply constraints of wafers and ceramic\nsubstrates in the second half of 2000. In both cases, strong demand for these\nitems from internal users and external original equipment manufacturer (OEM)\ncustomers exceeded the company's ability to supply these components. The company\nimproved its ability to manage this challenge toward the end of the year through\nshort-term and strategic actions.\n\n    IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new\nproducts, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology\npurchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These\nfactors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in\nthe immediately preceding fourth quarter.\n\n    The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future\nrevenues from the company's product offerings due to the significant proportion\nof revenue from services, the volume of products\n\n                                       2 delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product delivery\nschedules. With respect to the company's Global Services segment, in 2000 the\ncompany signed contracts totaling $55 billion, which contributed to a services\nbacklog at December 31, 2000 of $85 billion, compared with $60 billion at the\nend of 1999.\n\n    The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive\npressures. The company's businesses face a significant number of competitors,\nranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small,\nrapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes that\nits combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the\nbreadth of its products and service offerings are important competitive factors.\n\n    Intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the\ncompany's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss\nof market opportunity. Unlike many of its competitors, the company has a\nportfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses\nwhile competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product\nlines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its\nbusinesses to the same degree that its competitors do and these competitors may\nhave greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them than\nthe company businesses against which they compete.\n\n    The company operates in more than 150 countries worldwide and derives more\nthan half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the\nlaws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the\ncompany's business in those countries and the company's results of operations.\nThe company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and\npolitical changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including\nrecessions and inflation. For example, weakness in the Asian and Latin American\neconomies had an adverse effect on the company's business in 1998.\n\n    The following information is included in IBM's 2000 Annual Report to\nStockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:\n\n    Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or\nservices--Pages 89 through 93.\n\n    Financial information by geographic areas--Page 93.\n\n    Amount spent during each of the last three years on research and development\nactivities--Page 82.\n\n    Financial information regarding environmental activities--Page 78.\n\n    The number of persons employed by the registrant--Page 63.\n\n    The management discussion overview--Page 52.\n\n    Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in\nthis Annual Report may constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"Reform Act\").\nThe company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders\nand in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time\nto time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide\ncurrent expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include\nany statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.\nWords such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\"\n\"plans,\" \"projects,\" and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking\nstatements. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any\nforward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth below\nare cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements.\nReaders should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify\ncertain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially\nfrom those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The\nfollowing cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other\nfactors discussed\n\n                                       3 elsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference.\n\n    New Products and the Pace of Technological Change: The company's results of\noperations depend on the continued successful development and marketing of new\nand innovative products and services. The development of new products and\nservices requires significant capital investments by the company's various\nbusinesses and the success of these products and services depends on their\nacceptance by customers and business partners. Further, the company's businesses\nare characterized by rapid technological changes and corresponding shifts in\ncustomer demand, resulting in unpredictable product transitions and shortened\nlife cycles and increasing emphasis on being first to market with new products\nand services.\n\n    There can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce new\nproducts and services, that these products and services will be accepted by\ncustomers, or that the company's businesses will recoup or realize a return on\ntheir capital investments. In addition, from time to time the company may\nexperience difficulties or delays in the development, production or marketing of\nnew products and services.\n\n    Volatility of Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a\nnumber of factors, including quarterly variations in results, the competitive\nlandscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections\nby the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the\ncompany's stock price is subject to significant volatility.\n\n    Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success\nof the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled\npersonnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced\npersonnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and\ncompetition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that the\ncompany will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it\nneeds. Many of the company's key personnel receive a total compensation package\nthat includes stock options and other equity awards. New regulations, volatility\nin the stock market and other factors could diminish the value of the company's\nequity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the\ncompany to use more cash compensation.\n\n    Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant\npercentage of its non-U.S. revenues from its affiliates operating in local\ncurrency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative\nvalues of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the\ncompany's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of\ncredit risk and the creditworthiness of the customer, interest rate and currency\nfluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of\nresidual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these\nrisks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives\ninvolve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can\nbe no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be\nsuccessful.\n\n    Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through\na variety of third- party business partners, including distributors and\nresellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors\nand resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to\nbring its products to market.\n\n    Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to\nmake acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and\nalliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration\nof the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the\ncompany will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully.\n\n                                       4 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES:\n\n    At December 31, 2000, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the\nUnited States had aggregate floor space of 40.3 million square feet, of which\n31.5 million was owned and 8.8 million was leased. Of these amounts,\n1.5 million square feet was vacant and 2.2 million square feet was being leased\nto non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled\n15.0 million square feet, of which 10.9 million was owned and 4.1 million was\nleased. Of these amounts, 0.3 million square feet was vacant and 0.6 million\nsquare feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses.\n\n    Although improved production techniques, productivity gains and\ninfrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor\nspace, continuous upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological\nleadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand.

BUSINESS:\n \n    IBM develops, manufactures and sells advanced information processing\nproducts, including computers and microelectronic technology, software,\nnetworking systems and information technology-related services. The company\noffers value through its worldwide sales and service units in North America,\nEurope/Middle East/Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America by providing\ncomprehensive and competitive product choices.\n \n    The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future\nrevenues due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume\nof products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product\ndelivery schedules. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is\nnot material to an understanding of its business.\n \n    IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its products.\nLicenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others\nunder reasonable terms and conditions. IBM believes its business as a whole is\nnot materially dependent upon any particular patent or license, or any\nparticular group of patents or licenses.\n \n    The following information is included in IBM's 1996 Annual Report to\nStockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:\n \n        Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or\n    services--Pages 82 and 83.\n \n        Financial information by geographic areas--Pages 84 and 85.\n \n        Amount spent during each of the last three years on research and\n        development activities-- Page 68.\n \n        Financial information regarding environmental activities--Page 69.\n \n        The number of persons employed by the registrant--Page 55.\n \n        The management discussion overview--Page 44.\n \nITEM 2. PROPERTIES:\n \n    At December 31, 1996, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the\nUnited States had aggregate floor space of 49.7 million square feet, of which\n41.3 million was owned and 8.4 million was leased. Of these amounts, 9.1 million\nsquare feet was vacant and 2.5 million square feet was being leased to non-IBM\nbusinesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 15.1 million square\nfeet, of which 12.2 million was owned and 2.9 million was leased. Of these\namounts, .3 million square feet was vacant and .4 million square feet was being\nleased to non-IBM businesses.\n \n    Although improved production techniques, productivity gains and\nrestructuring actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space,\ncontinuous upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological\nleadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

BUSINESS:\n \n    IBM has two fundamental missions. First, the company strives to lead in the\ncreation, development and manufacture of the industry's most advanced\ninformation technologies, including computer systems, software, networking\nsystems, and microelectronics. Second, the company translates these advanced\ntechnologies into value for our customers worldwide through its sales and\nprofessional services units in North America, Europe/Middle East/Africa, Asia\nPacific, and Latin America.\n \n    Management continues to believe its decision, in 1993 to remain an\nintegrated provider of information technology rather then becoming an emerging\nfederation of companies, was the correct one. This single interface to the\ncustomer allows IBM employees to better understand and address the full range of\nthe customers' information needs and to provide them with comprehensive and\ntimely solutions.\n \n    The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future\nrevenues due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume\nof products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product\ndelivery schedules. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is\nnot material to an understanding of its business.\n \n    IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its products.\nLicenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others.\nIBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent upon any\nparticular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.\n \n    The following information is included in IBM's 1994 Annual Report to\nStockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:\n \n       1. Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or\n          services--Pages 74 and 75.\n \n       2. Financial information by geographic areas--Pages 76 and 77.\n \n       3. Amount spent during each of the last three years on research and\n          development activities--Page 59.\n \n       4. The number of persons employed by the registrant-- Page 47.\n \n       5. The management discussion overview--Page 36.\n \nITEM 2. PROPERTIES:\n \n    At December 31, 1994, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the\nUnited States had aggregate floor space of 55.2 million square feet, of which\n43.4 million was owned and 11.8 million was leased. Of these amounts, 8.5\nmillion square feet was vacant and 1.0 million square feet was being leased to\nnon-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 21.0\nmillion square feet, of which 18.0 million was owned and 3.0 million was leased.\nOf these amounts, 2.0 million square feet was vacant and .7 million square feet\nwas being leased to non-IBM businesses.\n \n    Although improved production techniques, productivity gains, and\nrestructuring actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space,\ncontinuous upgrading of facilities is essential to\n \n                                       1 maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer\ndemand.

Portions\nof IBM's definitive Proxy Statement dated March\u00a010, 2003 into Part\u00a0III of Form\u00a010-K. PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.\n(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. In 1924,\nC-T-R adopted the name International Business Machines Corporation. IBM\nuses advanced information technology to provide customer solutions. The company operates primarily in a single industry using several segments that create value by offering a variety\nof solutions that include, either singularly or in some combination, technologies, systems, products, services, software and financing. Organizationally,\nthe company's major operations comprise a Global Services segment; three hardware product segments\u2014Systems Group, Personal Systems Group and Technology\nGroup; a Software segment; a Global Financing segment and an Enterprise Investments segment. The segments are determined based on several factors, including customer base, homogeneity of products,\ntechnology and delivery channels. IBM\noffers its products through its global sales and distribution organizations. The sales and distribution organizations have both a geographic focus (in the Americas, Europe/Middle\nEast/Africa, and Asia Pacific) and a specialized and global industry focus. In addition, these organizations include a global sales and distribution effort devoted exclusively to small and medium\nbusinesses. IBM also offers its products through a variety of third party distributors and resellers, as well as through its on-line channels. While\nthe company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular\npatent or license, or any\nparticular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are\nbeing granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative of the\ncompany's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be\nable to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. IBM's\nbusinesses employ a wide variety of components, supplies and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a\nsingle or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver\ncomponents, supplies and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. IBM's\nrevenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's\nresults are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. The\nvalue of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues from the company's product offerings due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume\nof products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product delivery schedules. With respect to the company's Global Services segment, in 2002 the company signed contracts totaling\n$53\u00a0billion, which contributed to a services backlog at December\u00a031, 2002 of $112\u00a0billion, compared with $102\u00a0billion at the end of 2001. The\ncompany operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's businesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from Fortune 50 companies\nto 1 an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and\nthe breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. Intense\ncompetitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and /or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many\nof its competitors, the company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines.\nAs a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing\nresources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. The\ncompany operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the\ncountries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by\neconomic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation. The\nAudit Committee of the Board of Directors approved the categories of all non-audit services performed by the company's independent accountants during the period covered by this\nreport. The\nfollowing information is included in IBM's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference: Segment\ninformation and revenue by classes of similar products or services\u2014Pages\u00a0100 to 104. Financial\ninformation by geographic areas\u2014Page\u00a0104. Amount\nspent during each of the last three years on research and development activities\u2014Page\u00a090.

Forward-looking\nand Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in this Annual Report may constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"Reform Act\"). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to\nstockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of\nfuture events based on certain\nassumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\"\nand similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. The company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set\nforth below are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could\ncause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends. The following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other\nfactors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference. New\nProducts and the Pace of Technological Change: The company's results of operations depend on the continued successful development and marketing of new and innovative products and\nservices. The development of new products and services requires significant capital investments by the company's various businesses and the success of these products and services depends on their\nacceptance by customers and business partners. Further, the company's businesses are characterized by rapid technological changes and corresponding shifts in customer demand, resulting in\nunpredictable product 2 transitions and shortened life cycles and increasing emphasis on being first to market with new products and services. There\ncan be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce new products and services, that these products and services will be accepted by customers, or that the company's\nbusinesses will recoup or realize a return on their capital investments. In addition, from time to time the company may experience difficulties or delays in the development, production or marketing of\nnew products and services. Volatility\nof Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in results, the competitive landscape, general economic and\nmarket conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock price is subject to significant volatility. Dependence\non and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel, including technical,\nmarketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that the company\nwill be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. Many of the company's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes stock options and other equity\nawards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the value of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the\ncompany to use more cash compensation. Currency\nand Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments and\nits results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to\nthe concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the customer, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The\ncompany employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In\naddition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful. Distribution\nChannels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these\ndistributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. Acquisitions\nand Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant\nchallenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2002, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 34\u00a0million square feet, of\nwhich 23\u00a0million was owned and 11\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 4\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 2\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM\nbusinesses. Similar facilities in 16 other countries totaled 15\u00a0million square feet, of which 10\u00a0million was owned and 5\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 1\u00a0million\nsquare feet was vacant and 2\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous upgrading of facilities is\nessential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand.

An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statements. An audit also includes\nassessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\nbasis for our opinion. The\nstatements were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for use by the Company in connection with its various filings with\nthe Commission). Certain corporate assets, liabilities and corporate expenses, that are not the responsibility of the Reporting Unit, and which have not been allocated, have been excluded from the\nstatements. Accordingly, these statements are not intended to be a complete presentation of the financial position or results of operations of the Reporting Unit.

Portions\nof IBM's definitive Proxy Statement filed on or about March\u00a08, 2004 into Part\u00a0III of Form\u00a010-K. PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.\n(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection\nof business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled 80\u00a0years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to\nInternational Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is the largest information technology company in the world, the world's largest business and technology services company, the\nworld's largest consulting services organization, the world's largest information technology research organization, and the world's largest financier of information technology. *\n* * Over\nthe past decade, IBM has been a leader in the IT market's shift of focus from selling hardware, software, and services, to the creation of solutions to clients' business problems.\nDuring the early years of the Internet's entry into mainstream commerce, communications and business operations in the mid-to late-1990s, value was created first through providing widespread access\nand then through the integration of business processes, such as supply chain, customer relationships and human resources. Today, IBM is once again leading the industry toward the more fundamental,\nindustry-specific transformations of on demand business. In\nits relationships with its clients, IBM has found that a majority of enterprises are concerned with four main issues: \u2022 Demand\nfor faster innovation \u2022 Reducing\nexpenses \u2022 Integration\nacross the organization's \"value chain\" (representing every transaction or interaction within an enterprise, with other enterprises, and with individuals) \u2022 Demand\nfor predictable return on investment By\nredesigning their business processes and organizational structure, supported by and enabled by new systems operating environments, these clients are seeking to become \"On Demand\"\nbusinesses. IBM\ndefines an on demand business as an enterprise whose business processes are: \u2022 Responsive\nto any client demand, market opportunity, or external threat; \u2022 Integrated\nend-to-end across the company; and \u2022 Integrated\nacross industry value nets, the interconnected chains of partners, suppliers and clients. An\nessential aspect of an On Demand Operating Environment is that its infrastructure be based on industry-wide standards (commonly referred to as \"open standards\"). In IBM's\nview, an investment in such an infrastructure provides the greatest returns, rather than relying on proprietary control by a single company or affiliation of companies. One positive development in\nthis regard is the emergence of \"open source\" operating systems and programming languages that benefit from further\ndevelopment by the business and information technology (IT) communities, as in the case of the Linux operating system or the Java programming language. However,\nto realize the full benefits of an on demand environment, solutions with the highest returns also require the transformation and integration of business processes within and\namong institutions. IBM's\nclients include many different kinds of enterprises, from sole proprietorships to the world's largest organizations, governments and companies, representing every major industry\nand endeavor. 1 Over\nthe past decade, IBM has exited or greatly de-emphasized its involvement in consumer markets and divested itself of other non-core businesses to concentrate on the\nenterprise market. In IBM's view, the enterprise market represents approximately two-thirds of the IT industry's revenue, as well as twice the growth and three times the profits compared\nto consumer areas of the industry. As a result, IBM has made acquisitions and invested in emerging business opportunities important to its enterprise clients. Many of these investments have since\ngrown to a point where their revenue and opportunity now can be considered part of IBM's mainline businesses. The majority of the company's enterprise business, which excludes the company's original\nequipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors around which the company's sales and distribution activities, as well as an increasing\nnumber of its services and products businesses are organized: SECTOR INDUSTRIES Financial Services Banking Financial Markets Insurance Public Education Government Healthcare Life Sciences Industrial Aerospace Automotive Defense Chemical and Petroleum Electronics Distribution Consumer Products Retail Travel Transportation Communications Energy and Utilities Media and Entertainment Telecommunications Small Medium Business The majority of business in this sector have fewer than 1,000 employees The IT Industry and IBM's Strategy IBM operates in both the business services and IT industries, which are comprised of the following three categories: \u2022 Business\nValue \u2022 Infrastructure\nValue \u2022 Component\nValue The\nprimary rationale for IBM's investments in the Component Value category is to provide a competitive advantage in the Infrastructure Value category, which in turn is considered a\ncompetitive advantage in the Business Value category. IBM\nsees a shift in revenue and profit growth up from Component Value to Infrastructure Value and into the Business Value category, where revenue and profit potential are thought to be\ngreatest in the decade ahead. 2 Business Value: Overview:\nServices and software to improve business performance for its Enterprise Computing clients. IBM helps its Enterprise Computing clients transform their business processes and gain competitive\nadvantage by applying its skills and experience to processes specific to the client's industry or to business challenges across industries and processes. The company enters into long-term\nrelationships and creates solutions for clients, on its own or in partnership with other companies, drawing upon its broad product and service offerings, and relying on its BCS organization, the\ncapabilities of IBM Research, its experience in chip design and application, and the company's own viewpoint of developing trends in business and technology. Strategy:\nDrive on demand business innovation Capabilities: Business Consulting Services: Delivery of value to clients through consulting services for application innovation and systems integration, client\nrelationship management, financial management, human capital, business strategy and change, supply chain management, and the transformation of business processes and operations. (Global Services) Customer financing: Lease and loan financing to clients and internal clients for terms generally between two and five years. (Global Financing) Engineering\u00a0& Technology Services (E&TS): System and component design services, strategic outsourcing of clients' design teams, and technology\nand manufacturing consulting services. (Technology Group) On Demand Innovation Services (ODIS): IBM Research scientists and experts work with BCS consultants to analyze clients' business challenges and provide\nsolutions that address these challenges.

(All IBM Groups) Infrastructure Value: Overview: Hardware, software and services integrated into a computing environment. Infrastructure Value concerns systems, such as high-volume server\ncomputers; middleware software that can interconnect disparate operating systems and applications with data; storage networks and devices. It also refers to such services as infrastructure\nmanagement\u2014whether on the client's premises or managed remotely at IBM's own facilities\u2014and consulting about how to improve and strengthen the infrastructure and realize\ngreater return on investment in it. Central to IBM's approach for building value in the infrastructure category is its support of open standards and its active promotion of Linux, the open source\noperating system, which helps IBM's clients control costs and allows them to benefit from the latest developments created by the Linux development community around the world. To support Linux\ndevelopment and deployment, IBM has enabled its servers and storage products to operate with Linux, IBM's leading middleware products are designed to work in a\nLinux environment, and Linux is a preferred choice for many of the company's services and consulting engagements.

Capabilities: Application Specific Integrated Circuits: Manufacturing of customized semiconductor products for clients. (Technology Group) Advanced Foundry: Full suite of semiconductor manufacturing and integrated supply chain services using either a client's or IBM's design. (Technology\nGroup) Standard products and custom microprocessors: Semiconductors designed and manufactured primarily based upon IBM's PowerPC architecture. (Technology\nGroup) Business Segments Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise a Global Services segment; three hardware product segments\u2014Systems Group, Personal Systems\nGroup and Technology Group; a Software segment; and a Global Financing segment. See the IT Industry and IBM's Strategy section above for the specific capabilities relating to these business segments. Global Services is an important part of the company's strategy of providing insight and solutions to clients. While solutions often\ninclude industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a specific client solution requires it. Global Services outsourcing contracts as\nwell as BCS contracts with the U.S. Federal Government and its agencies are typically seven to ten years in duration. Other contracts range in periods generally up to one year, including consulting\ncontracts and ITS. The\ncompany's new Business Transformation Outsourcing (BTO) capabilities combine the insight of BCS with the company's process outsourcing capabilities to assume responsibility for the\noperations and management of a client's business processes in areas including human resources, procurement, customer relations management, finance and administration, among others. The company will\nonly enter into BTO agreements with clients when it believes that IBM can leverage its business knowledge and technology to drive client productivity and cost improvements. These generally are\nlarge-scale, multi-year contracts ranging up to ten years in length that include the operation transformation of the client's business processes. BTO engagements may include support and involvement of\nvarious business units that have capabilities such as BCS, Application Management Services, e-Business Hosting Services, middleware and hardware. Systems Group provides business solutions to clients. Approximately half of the Systems Group's sales transactions are through business\npartners and approximately 46\u00a0percent are direct to clients, slightly more than half of which are through the Web at ibm.com. While appropriately not reported as external revenue, hardware is\nalso deployed to support Global Services solutions. Technology Group provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering technology services to OEM\nclients (approximately 78\u00a0percent) and, although appropriately not reported as external revenue, to the Systems Group (approximately 21\u00a0percent). Using\na \"one-team\" approach, Systems Group works hand-in-hand with the Technology Group on product planning and strategy given the high content level\nof Technology Group components inside Systems Group products. In recognition of the increasing degree of collaboration between the two segments and as discussed on page 118 of the IBM 2003 Annual\nReport which is hereby incorporated 5 by\nreference, the company combined the Systems Group and the Technology Group in the first quarter of 2004. Personal Systems Group includes the company's lines of personal computers, printers and point-of-sale terminals.\nThese offerings are designed to assist clients to improve productivity and to reduce clients' total cost of ownership. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,\nprocesses, and applications across the clients' enterprise through the use of open standards. Middleware is designed to be the underlying support for applications provided by business partner\nindependent software vendors (ISVs) who build industry- or process-specific applications according to open industry standards. Operating systems are the engines that run computers. Approximately\n70\u00a0percent of Software volumes are directly with the end-user clients and about 20\u00a0percent are through Business Partners. While appropriately not reported as external\nrevenue, the remainder is deployed internally to support Global Services solutions. Approximately\n40\u00a0percent of external Software revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements whereby the client pays one up-front payment for a\nlifetime license. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product\nupgrades and technical support. The remaining software is sold on a monthly license charge arrangement. Global Financing is described on pages\u00a069 to 73 of the IBM 2003 Annual Report which are hereby incorporated by reference. Enterprise Investments develops and provides industry-specific IT solutions supporting the Hardware, Software and Global Services segments\nof the company. Primary product lines include product life cycle management software and document processing technologies. Product life cycle management software primarily serves the Industrial sector\nand helps clients manage the development and manufacturing of their products. Document processor products service the Financial Services sector and include products that enable electronic banking. IBM Worldwide Organizations The following three company-wide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales\nand Distribution Organization, and related sales channels \u2022 Research,\nDevelopment, and Intellectual Property \u2022 Supply\nChain Sales\u00a0& Distribution Organization IBM offers its products through its Global Sales and Distribution organizations. Consistent with IBM's focus on Business Value, the company's global corps of\naccount representatives combine a deep understanding of each client's organizational and industry-specific needs with comprehensive knowledge of the products, technologies, and services offered by IBM\nand its network of business partners. IBM\nalso offers its products through a variety of other internal and external channels: Four of these channels comprise IBM's Business Partner relationships, through which the company\nreceives approximately one-third of its revenue. Internal Routes-to-Market Global Services consultants: Particularly in selling end-to-end solutions for large, complex business challenges, IBM very often relies on\nthe practitioners and consultants within its Global Services unit, as 6 these\nchallenges generally require integrating services and on demand solutions from IBM and other suppliers. Hardware\nand software brand specialists: IBM's own hardware and software brand product specialists work face-to-face with clients, selling IBM platforms as part\nof a discrete technology platform decision, typically to \"self-integrating\" IT departments. ibm.com:\nOnline and telephone sales and assistance operations handle basic commodity transactions for large enterprises and small-to-medium businesses. Business Partners Routes-to-Market Global/major independent software vendors: ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications and, in doing so, often influence the sale of IBM\nhardware, middleware and services. Global/major\nsystems integrators (SIs): SIs identify business problems and design solutions when Global Services is not the preferred systems integrator; they also sell computing\ninfrastructures from IBM and its competitors. Regional\nISVs and SIs: SIs identify the business problems, and ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications to medium-sized and large businesses requiring IBM\ncomputing infrastructure offerings. Solutions\nproviders, resellers and distributors: Resellers sell IBM platforms and value-added services as part of a discrete technology platform decision to clients wanting third-party\nassistance. Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate IBM from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $5\u00a0billion for R&D, including\ncapitalized software costs, focusing its investments in high-growth opportunities. Recent such efforts include e-business, initiatives to support Linux, middleware software\nproducts, autonomic computing, advanced semiconductor technology, and other technologies supporting On Demand. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S.\npatents in 2003 than any other company. This marks the 11th year in a row that IBM achieved this distinction. A\nkey transformation that has been taking place over the past decade and continues today is the change in the focus and the culture of IBM's R&D organization to be more closely linked to\nand primarily driven by industry-specific and client-specific needs. Significant successes have been achieved by this changing focus, such as autonomic computing and Linux developments, as mentioned\nabove. In\naddition to producing world-class products and solutions for the company's clients, the company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income. Some of IBM's\ntechnological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are used by the company's licensees for their products when that new technology is not strategic to IBM's business goals.\nA third group is both used internally and licensed externally. In\naddition to these IP income sources, the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through cross-licensing arrangements and IP licensed in divestiture transactions.\nCross-licensing arrangements involve licensing of the company's IP to a third party in exchange for the right to use third party's IP. The value of these other two sources is not readily apparent in\nthe financial results on pages\u00a054 and 74 of the IBM 2003 Annual Report which are hereby incorporated by reference, due to the fact that income on cross-licensing arrangements is recorded only\nto the extent cash is received. The value received by IBM for IP transferred in divestiture transactions is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture, not in the separately displayed\nIP income amounts on pages\u00a054 and 74 of the IBM 2003 Annual Report which are hereby incorporated by reference. 7 Supply Chain Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiencies and responsiveness to market conditions, IBM has undertaken a large-scale\ninitiative to re-cast IBM's own supply chain as an on demand business operation, thereby turning what had previously been a cost/expense to be managed into a strategic advantage for the\ncompany and, ultimately, for its clients. IBM\nspends nearly $39\u00a0billion annually in its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. Prior to 2002, the company's supply, manufacturing, and distribution\noperations were spread across its product brands and service offerings. These are now integrated in one operating unit that can: \u2022 Understand\nand respond to marketplace opportunities and external risks, as well as the needs of clients, employees and partners \u2022 Convert\nfixed costs to variable costs \u2022 Simplify\nand streamline internal operations to improve sales force productivity and processes and thereby, continuing to improve the experiences of the company's clients\nwhen working with IBM \u2022 Reduce\ninventories The\ncost savings this unit generates provides two opportunities for the company: directly improve financial results mostly through improved gross profit margins or improve\ncompetitiveness and market share by passing some or all of the cost savings to clients. Accordingly, the cost savings generated by\nthis unit will not always result in a dollar-for-dollar apparent gross margin improvement in the company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. While\nthese efforts are largely concerned with product manufacturing and delivery, IBM is also applying supply chain principles to service delivery across its solutions and services\nlines of business. By\nthe end of 2003, the work of transforming and integrating its supply chain resulted in the lowest inventory levels for IBM in more than 20\u00a0years. In\naddition to its own manufacturing operations, the company uses a number of contract manufacturing (CM) companies around the world to manufacture IBM-designed products. The\nuse of CM companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time-to-market for certain IBM products. Some of the company's relationships with CM companies are exclusive. IBM has key\nrelationships with Sanmina-SCI for the manufacture of many Intel-based products, or with Solectron for a significant portion of the manufacturing operations of Global Asset Recovery\nServices\u2014an operation of Global Financing that restores end-of-lease personal computers and other IT equipment for resale. Further, some IBM-branded\nproducts are manufactured by third-party OEMs\u00a0and then purchased by IBM and resold under the IBM brand. Significant Factors Affecting IBM's Business Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in this Annual Report may constitute \"forward-looking\nstatements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"Reform Act\"). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words\nsuch as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. The company assumes no obligation to\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth below are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully\nreview these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical\ntrends. The following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed 8 elsewhere\nin this Annual Report, in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated therein by reference. Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets: Although the diverse nature of IBM's capabilities somewhat mitigates\nthe impact of economic volatility on IBM's results, the company's financial performance is impacted by overall marketplace spending. Although IT spending is an important driver of IBM's financial\nresults, a key objective is to outperform key competitors and gain market share during strong and weak economic environments. Hardware\nand a large majority of the company's software business are more sensitive to changing demands associated with changes in the economic environment. The company's mix of\nofferings with contractual long-term cash and income streams and offerings with cyclical transaction-based sales, combined with the company's strategies discussed in the next two\nparagraphs, are designed to result in increased market share gains in strong and weak economies. Technology\nGroup's Microelectronics business is also particularly sensitive to cyclical changes in that industry; although such sensitivity has been greatly reduced in recent years\nthrough the company's exit of some of the commodity segments of that industry, such as dynamic random access memory (DRAM). Movements in the general or industry-specific economic environment create\nfinancial opportunities and challenges with respect to the company's consulting business and certain of its inventories. To\nthe extent demand for Global Services sharply and unexpectedly declines, the company may have excess people resources. As a result, the company may be required to decide whether to\nhave a workforce action resulting in additional severance charges (which could result in charges to Selling, General and Administration expense), or to carry an underutilized consulting workforce in\nthe hopes that the economic drop is short-term in nature (which could reduce services gross\nmargins). Conversely, to the extent that the demand for Global Services sharply and unexpectedly increases, the company could be required to quickly identify and hire the correct number of consultants\nwith the appropriate skills at the same time that its competitors have the same goals. The company manages these risks by forecasting future demand and by the selected use of subcontracted labor. As\nreferenced above, the company's supply chain initiatives are also an integral part of managing these risks to the Global Services business. To\nthe extent demand for hardware products sharply and unexpectedly declines, the company may be left with excess or obsolete inventory (which could result in write-downs to cost of\ngoods sold and therefore, in lower gross margins). Management attempts to mitigate this risk by careful forecasting and through the supply chain initiatives discussed above. Part of the supply chain\ninitiatives is the reduction of inventory levels on hand. Conversely, a sudden and unexpected rise in demand may result in supply constraints (which could reduce revenue and gross margins to the\nextent there are stranded fixed costs). Again, the company minimizes this risk through its supply chain initiatives that convert traditionally fixed cost and inflexible aspects of the supply chain\ninto a variable and flexible source of supply: one of the pillars of an on demand business. Internal Business Transformation and Efficiency Initiatives: Key to the success of IBM's strategy are its ongoing efforts to\ndrive greater productivity and cost savings as IBM continues to transform itself into an on demand enterprise. Integral to these efforts will be the internal supply chain initiatives discussed above\nas well the company's efforts to manage the cost of its resources worldwide. These efforts will continue to include the rebalancing of skills, developing the most cost-effective workforce\nstructure, and continuing to make company's compensation programs competitive and aligned with organizational units. The degree of continued success in this area will impact the amount of company\nexpense and cost structure improvements, as well as the amount of competitive leverage it can apply by passing such savings along to clients. Technology Innovations: IBM invests for new and innovative products and services. IBM has been moving away from commoditized\ncategories of the IT industry and into areas where it can differentiate 9 itself\nthrough innovation, and by leveraging its investments in R&D. Examples include IBM's leadership position in the design and fabrication of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs); the\ndesign of smaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices (using industry-leading innovations such as copper technology, silicon on insulator, silicon germanium, low-K\ndielectric, and nanotechnology); the design of \"autonomic\" or self-managing computing systems and \"grid\" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power; and the\ncompany's efforts to advance open technology standards such as Linux. In the highly competitive IT industry with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single-technology\ncompetitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is absolutely critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its\nR&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs, as discussed on page\u00a07 of this Form\u00a010-K. Open Standards: The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for e-business on\ndemand. Without the open standards that enable all manner of computing platforms to communicate and work with one another, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes\nremains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards\u2014rather than closed, proprietary architectures\u2014also allows the computing infrastructure to\nmore easily absorb new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they benefit clients, because they are vital to the on demand computing model, and because their\nacceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. IBM's support is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, as\nwell as its recent acquisition of Rational. Rational's software development tools can be used to develop and upgrade any other company's software products. Accordingly, this acquisition is a critical\npart of IBM's open standards strategy. Protection of Intellectual Property: While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to\nits success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a\nnumber of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These\nprotections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will\nadequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw\nmaterials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure\nthat alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely\nmanner could adversely affect the company's business. Seasonality of Revenues: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the\nsales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter\nthan in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. Local Legal and Economic Conditions: The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of\nits revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's\nresults of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation. 10 Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's\nbusinesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company\nbelieves that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. Intense\ncompetitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of\nits competitors, the company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As\na result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources\navailable to them than the businesses against which they compete. Volatility of Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in\nresults, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock\nprice is subject to significant volatility. Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service\nand availability of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. Many of the company's key personnel receive a total\ncompensation package that includes stock options and other equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the value of the company's equity awards,\nputting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from\nits affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S.\ndollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency\nfluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative\nfinancial instruments. Derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be\nsuccessful. Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and\nresellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from\ntime to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will\nmanage acquisitions and alliances successfully. Backlog: The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues from the company's product offerings\ndue to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product delivery schedules. With respect to the company's\nGlobal Services segment, in 2003 the company signed contracts totaling $55\u00a0billion, which contributed to a services backlog at December\u00a031, 2003 of $120\u00a0billion, compared with\n$112\u00a0billion at the end of 2002. 11 The\nfollowing information is included in IBM's 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference: Segment\ninformation and revenue by classes of similar products or services\u2014pages\u00a0117 to 121.

Properties: At December\u00a031, 2003, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 33\u00a0million square feet, of\nwhich 24\u00a0million was owned and 9\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 4\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 2\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM\nbusinesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 10\u00a0million square feet, of which 6\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 1\u00a0million\nsquare feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous upgrading of facilities is\nessential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand.

These statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on\nthese statements based on our audit. We\nconducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statements. An audit also\nincludes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the statements. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion. The\nstatements were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for use by the Company in connection with its various\nfilings with the Commission). Certain corporate assets, liabilities and corporate expenses, that are not the responsibility of the Reporting Unit, and which have not been allocated, have been excluded\nfrom the statements. Accordingly, these statements are not intended to be a complete presentation of the financial position or results of operations of the Reporting Unit. In\nour opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Reporting Unit as of\nDecember\u00a031, 2003 and for the three months then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. /s/\nErnst\u00a0& Young LLP Ernst\u00a0&\nYoung LLP New York, New York January\u00a015, 2004 21 SCHEDULE II INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS AND RESERVES For the Years Ended December\u00a031: (Dollars in Millions) Description Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses Write-offs Other (A) Balance at End of Period Allowance For Doubtful Accounts 2003 \u2014Current $ 1,312 $ 158 $ 476 $ 106 $ 1,100 \u2014Noncurrent $ 109 $ 49 $ 39 $ \u2014 $ 119 2002 \u2014Current $ 984 $ 628 $ 349 $ 49 $ 1,312 \u2014Noncurrent $ 97 $ 45 $ 54 $ 21 $ 109 2001 \u2014Current $ 860 $ 418 $ 269 $ (25 ) $ 984 \u2014Noncurrent $ 87 $ 73 $ 49 $ (14 ) $ 97 Allowance For Inventory Losses 2003 $ 696 $ 407 $ 442 $ 60 $ 721 2002 $ 726 $ 780 $ 790 $ (20 ) $ 696 2001 $ 695 $ 590 $ 582 $ 23 $ 726 (A) Primarily\ncomprises currency translation adjustments.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.\n(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection\nof business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled 80\u00a0years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to\nInternational Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is the largest information technology company in the world, the world's largest business and technology services company, the\nworld's largest consulting services organization, the world's largest information technology research organization, and the world's largest financier of information technology. *\n* * IBM\nis an innovation-based business serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. It defines innovation as the intersection of business insight and technological\ninvention. IBM seeks to deliver client success\u2014in whatever ways its clients define success\u2014by giving them differentiating capabilities that provide unique competitive\nadvantage. By\nhelping its clients redesign their business processes and organizational structure, enabled by new operating environments, IBM helps them to become on demand businesses. IBM defines\nan on demand business as an enterprise whose business processes are responsive to any demand, opportunity or threat; integrated end-to-end across the company; and capable of\nintegrating fluidly across extended business ecosystems of partners, suppliers and clients. IBM\nfirst described this new model and set of capabilities in 2002, believing they represent the current evolution of information technology architectures and of business and\ninstitutional models. IBM calls this architecture the On Demand Operating Environment: an infrastructure based on industry-wide standards (commonly referred to as \"open standards\"), rather\nthan proprietary technologies. In IBM's view, an enterprise's investment in such an infrastructure provides both superior returns and maximum freedom of interoperability and action. Standards have\nbecome a core element of IBM's overall strategy and impact all of our unit strategies. The\nshift to standards-based technologies has been bolstered significantly in recent years by the rapid growth of the \"open source\" software movement, a result of large-scale\ncollaboration among members of the worldwide developer and business communities. Examples include the Linux operating system, the Eclipse computing platform and the Java programming language. IBM's\nclients include many different kinds of enterprises, from sole proprietorships to the world's largest organizations, governments and companies representing every major industry and\nendeavor. Over the last decade, IBM has exited or greatly de-emphasized its involvement in consumer markets and divested itself of other noncore businesses to concentrate on the enterprise\nmarket. In IBM's view, opportunities in the enterprise market are superior\u2014representing approximately two-thirds of the IT industry's revenue. As a result, IBM has made\nacquisitions and invested in emerging business opportunities important to its enterprise clients. Many of these investments have grown into multibillion dollar businesses in their own right, and are\nnow contributing to IBM's growth. The\nmajority of the company's enterprise business, which excludes the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped\ninto six sectors around which the company's go-to-market strategies, and sales and distribution activities are organized: \u2022 Financial\nServices: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance 1 \u2022 Public:\nEducation, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial:\nAerospace, Automotive, Defense, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution:\nConsumer Products, Retail, Travel, Transportation \u2022 Communications:\nTelecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 Small\nand Medium Business: mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees The IT Industry and IBM's Strategy IBM operates in the IT industry, which comprises three principal categories: \u2022 Business\nValue \u2022 Infrastructure\nValue \u2022 Component\nValue IBM\nhas realized and continues to see a shift in revenue and profit growth from Component Value to Infrastructure Value and Business Value, where revenue and profit potential are thought\nto be greatest in the years ahead. Business Value The company helps its clients transform their businesses and gain competitive advantage by applying its skills and experience to business performance challenges\nspecific to the client's industry or across industries and processes. The company enters into long-term relationships and creates solutions for clients, driving on demand business\ninnovation, on its own or in partnership with other companies.

(Systems and\nTechnology Group) 4 Business Segments Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise a Global Services segment; a Systems and Technology Group; a Personal Systems Group; a Software segment;\na Global Financing segment; and an Enterprise Investments segment. Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing insight and solutions to clients. While solutions often\ninclude industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Global Services outsourcing contracts as well as BCS contracts range from\nless than one year to ten years. Systems and Technology Group provides IBM's clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities.\nMore than half of the Systems and Technology Group's eServer and Storage Systems sales transactions are through business partners and approximately 40\u00a0percent are direct to end-user\nclients and more than half are through the Web at ibm.com. In addition, the group provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering technology services to OEM\nclients (approximately 14\u00a0percent of Systems and Technology Group revenue) and for IBM's own advanced technology needs. While appropriately not reported as external revenue, hardware is also\ndeployed to support Global Services solutions. Personal Systems Group includes sales of personal computers, business and computing solutions for retail stores and advanced printing\ncapabilities for large enterprise clients and small and medium-sized businesses. In December\u00a02004, it was announced that Lenovo Group Limited, the largest information technology company in\nChina, will acquire IBM's Personal Computing Division. This transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2005. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,\nprocesses and applications across their enterprises. Middleware is designed\nto be the underlying support for applications provided by independent software vendors (ISVs), who build industry- or process-specific applications according to open industry standards. Operating\nsystems are the engines that run computers. Approximately 40\u00a0percent of external Software revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements, whereby the client pays one up-front\npayment for a lifetime license. The remaining annuity revenue consists of both maintenance revenue sold with OTC arrangements, as well as software sold on a monthly license charge (MLC) arrangement.\nTypically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and\ntechnical support. Global Financing is described on pages 35 to 39 of IBM's 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders which is hereby incorporated by reference. Enterprise Investments develops and provides industry-specific IT solutions supporting the Hardware, Software and Global Services segments\nof the company. Primary product lines include product life cycle management software and document processing technologies. Product life cycle management software primarily serves the Industrial sector\nand helps clients manage the development and manufacturing of their products. Document processor products service the Financial Services sector and include products that enable electronic banking. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following three company-wide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales\u00a0&\nDistribution Organization and related sales channels \u2022 Research,\nDevelopment and Intellectual Property \u2022 Integrated\nSupply Chain 5 Sales\u00a0& Distribution Organization With comprehensive knowledge of IBM's business and infrastructure solutions, as well as the individual products, technologies and services offered by IBM and its\nnetwork of business partners, the company's global team of account representatives and solutions professionals gain a deep understanding of each client's organizational, infrastructure and\nindustry-specific needs to determine the best approach for addressing the client's critical business and IT challenges. These professionals work in integrated teams with IBM consultants and technology\nrepresentatives, combining their deep skills and expertise to deliver high-value solutions. Internal Routes-to-Market Global Services consultants focused on selling end-to-end solutions for large, complex business challenges. Hardware\nand software brand specialists selling IBM products as parts of discrete technology decisions, typically to \"self-integrating\" IT departments. ibm.com\nOnline and telephone sales and assistance operations handle basic commodity transactions for large enterprises and small-to-medium businesses. Business Partners Routes-to-Market Global/major independent software vendors (ISVs). ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications and, in doing so, often influence the sale of\nIBM hardware, middleware and services. Global/major\nsystems integrators (SIs). SIs identify business problems and design solutions when Global Services is not the preferred systems integrator; they also sell computing\ninfrastructures from IBM and its competitors. Regional\nISVs and SIs. SIs identify the business problems, and ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications to medium-sized and large businesses requiring IBM\ncomputing infrastructure offerings. Solutions\nproviders, resellers and distributors. Resellers sell IBM platforms and value-added services as part of a discrete technology platform decision to clients wanting third-party\nassistance. Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate IBM from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $5-6\u00a0billion for R&D,\nincluding capitalized software costs, focusing its investments in high-growth opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S.\npatents in 2004 than any other company. This marks the 12th year in a row that IBM achieved this distinction. In\naddition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing\nservices activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are\nused by the company's licensees for their products when that new technology is not strategic to IBM's business goals. A third group is both used internally and licensed externally. In\naddition to these IP income sources, the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through cross-licensing arrangements and IP licensed in divestiture transactions. The\nvalue of these other two sources is not readily apparent in the financial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings, because income on cross-licensing arrangements is recorded only to the extent\ncash is received. The value received by IBM for IP involving the sale of a business is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture, not in the separately displayed IP income amounts in\nfinancial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 6 In\nJanuary\u00a02005, IBM announced that it would pledge 500 of its patents for use by the open computing community, representing a major shift in the way IBM manages and deploys its\nintellectual property portfolio. IBM's intent is to help form an industry-wide \"patent commons,\" in which patents are used to establish a platform for further innovation in areas of broad\ninterest to information technology developers and users. The pledge is applicable to any individual, community, or company working on or using software that meets the Open Source Initiative (OSI)\ndefinition of open source software. Integrated Supply Chain Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to market conditions, IBM has undertaken a large-scale\ninitiative to recast its own integrated supply chain as an on demand business operation, turning what had previously been an expense to be managed into a strategic advantage for the company and,\nultimately, improved delivery and outcomes for its clients. IBM spends approximately $41\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The\ncompany's supply, manufacturing and distribution operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and\nconverted fixed to variable costs. Simplifying and streamlining internal operations has improved sales force productivity and processes and thereby the experiences of the company's clients when\nworking with IBM. Because some of the cost savings this unit generates are passed along to clients, they will not always result in a visible gross margin improvement in the company's Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings. While these efforts are largely concerned with product manufacturing and delivery, IBM is also applying supply chain principles to service delivery across its solutions and\nservices lines of business. To accomplish this, IBM is creating a new labor resource management system\u2014based on a uniform taxonomy of skills\u2014that will enable the organization\nto more efficiently match its labor resources to the needs of IBM clients, deploy the right expertise quickly, and create a better short-term and long-term balance of labor\nsupply and demand by comparing the demands of the market against the database of available skills. In\naddition to its own manufacturing operations, the company uses a number of contract manufacturing (CM) companies around the world to manufacture IBM-designed products. The\nuse of CM companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time-to-market for certain IBM products. Some of the company's relationships with CM companies are\nexclusive. The company has key relationships with Sanmina-SCI for the manufacture of some Intel-based products and with Solectron for a significant portion of the manufacturing operations\nof Global Asset Recovery Services\u2014an operation of Global Financing that restores end-of-lease personal computers and other IT equipment for resale. Significant Factors Affecting IBM's Business Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in this Annual Report may constitute \"forward-looking\nstatements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"Reform Act\"). The company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Words\nsuch as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking statements. The company assumes no obligation to\nupdate or revise any forward-looking statements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth below are cautionary statements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should carefully\nreview these cautionary statements as they identify certain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical\ntrends. The following cautionary statements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filing with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission or in materials incorporated therein by reference. 7 Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets: If overall demand for hardware, software and services changes,\nwhether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse portfolio of products and offerings is designed to gain market\nshare in strong and weak economic climates. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams as well as cyclical transaction-based\nsales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand\ntrends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. Internal Business Transformation and Efficiency Initiatives: IBM continues to drive greater productivity and cost savings as\nit transforms itself into an on demand enterprise. This includes the internal supply chain initiatives discussed above, as well as driving collaboration across the IBM enterprise to stimulate\ninnovation and drive growth. Transformation efforts are improving the company's management of its costs worldwide: the rebalancing of skills, optimizing its workforce to drive growth, keeping the\ncompany's compensation programs competitive, and creating a cost efficient and cutting-edge IT infrastructure to support its transformation. IBM is extending its supply chain initiatives to labor\ncosts and other internal processes. Continued success in this area will impact the company's cost structure\nimprovements, as well as the amount of competitive leverage it can apply by passing savings along to clients. Innovation Initiatives: IBM invests for new and innovative capabilities, products and services. IBM has been moving away from\ncommoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. Examples include IBM's leadership position\nin the design and fabrication of ASICs; the design of smaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; the design of \"grid\" computing networks that allow computers to share processing\npower; the transformation and integration of business processes; and the company's efforts to advance open technology standards and to engage with governments, academia, think tanks and\nnongovernmental organizations on emerging trends in technology, society and culture. In the highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single-\ntechnology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its\nR&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs, as discussed in description of Business\u2014IBM Worldwide Organizations. Open Standards: The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a\nsignificant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications\nand processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards\u2014rather than closed, proprietary architectures\u2014also allows the computing\ninfrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and\nbecause their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in the IT industry with significant resources and\ninvestments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition will result in increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims\nand proceedings. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, and the development of Rational software development tools, which\ncan be used to develop and upgrade any other company's software products. Emerging Business Opportunities: The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise\ncomputing\u2014providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in Emerging Business\nOpportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gain. Areas of investment 8 include\nstrategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, information-based medicine, on demand retail, sensor and actuator solutions, Business Performance Transformation Services, key\ntechnologies (POWER5 and POWERBlade) and emerging growth countries such as China, Russia, India and Brazil. Protection of Intellectual Property: While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to\nits success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a\nnumber of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These\nprotections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will\nadequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw\nmaterials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure\nthat alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely\nmanner could adversely affect the company's business. Seasonality of Revenues: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the\nsales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter\nthan in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. Local Legal and Economic Conditions: The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than half of\nits revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the company's\nresults of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and inflation. Environmental Matters. The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning\nthe discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,\nfines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance\nwith environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. Internal Controls. Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to\nits financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's brand and\noperating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including\nmanagement's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the\npossibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and\nfair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the\ncontrol may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its 9 internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating\nresults could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's\nbusinesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company\nbelieves that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. Intense\ncompetitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of\nits competitors, the company has a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As\na result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing\nresources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. Volatility of Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in\nresults, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the company's stock\nprice is subject to significant volatility. Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service\nand availability of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to\nsuccessfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. Many of the company's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the\nstock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more\ncash compensation. Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from\nits affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the\ncompany's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and\nliabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the\nrisk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful. Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and\nresellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from\ntime to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will\nmanage acquisitions and alliances successfully. Backlog: The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future revenues from the company's product offerings\ndue to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume of products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product delivery schedules. With respect to the company's\nGlobal Services segment, in 2004 the company signed contracts totaling $43 billion, which contributed to a services backlog at December\u00a031, 2004 of $111 billion, compared with\n$120\u00a0billion at the end of 2003. 10 The following information is included in IBM's 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated herein by reference: Segment\ninformation and revenue by classes of similar products or services\u2014pages 87 through 91.

Properties: At December\u00a031, 2004, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 27\u00a0million square feet, of\nwhich 20\u00a0million was owned and\u00a07\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts,\u00a03\u00a0million square feet was vacant and\u00a01\u00a0million square feet was being leased to\nnon-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 9\u00a0other countries totaled 9\u00a0million square feet, of which\u00a06\u00a0million was owned and\u00a03\u00a0million was leased.\nOf these amounts,\u00a01\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous upgrading of facilities is\nessential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand.

These statements are the\nresponsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on our audits. We\nconducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company\u00a0Accounting Oversight Board (United\u00a0States). Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and\ndisclosures in the statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The\nstatements were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for use by the Company in connection with its various\nfilings with the Commission). Certain corporate assets, liabilities and corporate expenses, that are not the responsibility of the Reporting Unit, and which have not been allocated, have been excluded\nfrom the statements. Accordingly, these statements are not intended to be a complete presentation of the financial position or results of operations of the Reporting Unit. In\nour opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and liabilities of the Reporting Unit as of December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003 and\nits revenues and expenses for the years ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003 and for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2002, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. /s/ Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP ERNST\u00a0& YOUNG LLP New York, New York February\u00a022, 2005 20 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO\nTHE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION We\nhave examined management's assertion that the controls over the initiation and recording of revenue transactions and the recording of direct costs of the Business Consulting Services\nReporting Unit (\"the Reporting Unit\") (a reporting unit as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.\u00a0142), of International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\") are effective,\nas of December\u00a031, 2004. Management is responsible for its controls over the initiation and recording of revenue transactions and the recording of direct costs of the Reporting Unit. Our\nresponsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion based on our examination. The\ncontrol objectives that formed the basis for management's assertion included (1)\u00a0credit checks, contract pricing, contract terms and conditions, and a valid signed contract\nare obtained, reviewed and approved, and non-standard contract terms and conditions are identified for review prior to revenue recognition; (2)\u00a0invoices are generated based on\ncontract terms and conditions and reviewed prior to issuance; (3)\u00a0revenues and accounts receivable are monitored and appropriate adjustments are made timely; (4)\u00a0costs are appropriately\nand timely captured by contract and business unit and reconciled with related revenues; and (5)\u00a0losses on contracts are identified and appropriate provisions made based on established\naccounting policies. Our\nexamination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included obtaining an\nunderstanding of the controls over the initiation and recording of revenue transactions and the recording of direct costs of the Reporting Unit, testing and evaluating the design and operating\neffectiveness of those controls, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our\nexamination was limited to those controls that are applied to individual revenue transactions that are initiated within the Reporting Unit, and to those controls that are applied to\nthe direct costs by Reporting Unit personnel. Our examination did not extend to IBM's internal control over financial reporting as it relates to applications and controls that are common to all\nreporting units within IBM, or to IBM entity-level controls, including those that also affect the recording of the Reporting Unit's revenues and direct costs. Because\nof inherent limitations in any internal control, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the controls over the\ninitiation and recording of revenue transactions and the recording of direct costs of the Reporting Unit to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the controls may deteriorate. In\nour opinion, management's assertion that the controls over the initiation and recording of revenue transactions and the recording of direct costs of the Reporting Unit are effective\nas of December\u00a031, 2004, is fairly stated in all material respects, based on the control objectives described above. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP ERNST\u00a0& YOUNG LLP New York, New York February\u00a022, 2005 21 SCHEDULE II INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS AND RESERVES For the Years Ended December\u00a031: (Dollars in Millions) Description Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses Writeoffs Other (A) Balance at End of Period Allowance For Doubtful Accounts 2004 \u2014Current $ 1,100 $ 115 $ 296 $ 52 $ 971 \u2014Noncurrent $ 119 $ 14 $ 43 $ 7 $ 97 2003 \u2014Current $ 1,312 $ 158 $ 476 $ 106 $ 1,100 \u2014Noncurrent $ 109 $ 49 $ 39 $ \u2014 $ 119 2002 \u2014Current $ 984 $ 628 $ 349 $ 49 $ 1,312 \u2014Noncurrent $ 97 $ 45 $ 54 $ 21 $ 109 Allowance For Inventory Losses 2004 $ 721 $ 327 $ 428 $ 35 $ 655 2003 $ 696 $ 407 $ 442 $ 60 $ 721 2002 $ 726 $ 780 $ 790 $ (20 ) $ 696 Revenue Based Provisions 2004 $ 1,088 $ 5,184 $ 5,247 $ 23 $ 1,048 2003 $ 995 $ 4,905 $ 4,853 $ 41 $ 1,088 2002 $ 1,056 $ 4,281 $ 4,342 $ \u2014 $ 995 (A) Primarily\ncomprises currency translation adjustments.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co.\n(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection\nof business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 80\u00a0years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to\nInternational Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is the largest information technology company in the world, the world's largest business and technology services company, the\nworld's largest consulting services organization, the world's largest information technology research organization, and the world's largest financier of information technology. *\n* * Description of Business IBM is an innovation company, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. IBM seeks to deliver clients success by enabling their own capacity to\ninnovate, so that they may differentiate their organizations to create unique competitive advantage. To\nhelp its clients achieve growth, productivity, efficiency, and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon the world's leading systems, software and services\ncapabilities to turn enterprises of all sizes, in every major industry, into on demand businesses. An on demand business is an enterprise that is integrated end-to-end, and,\nwith its business\necosystems of partners, suppliers and clients, is able to manage that extended network dynamically to address new opportunities, respond to changes in demand or threats to its business, enhance\nflexibility, speed execution and ultimately achieve profitable growth. In\nIBM's view, being on demand is the most comprehensive way to enable a company to innovate\u2014and thus differentiate itself\u2014consistently over time. IBM views\nenterprise innovation not only in terms of products and services, but across all dimensions of a business: its business processes, business model, management systems, culture and role in society. IBM's Strategy IBM's strategy is to pursue an innovation agenda with its clients, partners and in other relationships, and to continue refining its portfolio to achieve higher\nvalue. Through its understanding of where technology, client requirements and global business are headed, the company continually makes strategic decisions to maintain its leadership of this rapidly\nchanging business by focusing on high-value innovation-based solutions and services while consistently generating high returns on invested capital for its shareholders. The company\nutilizes its entire portfolio\u2014hardware, software, services, technology and research to maintain its leadership. With those broad capabilities to enable enterprise innovation, the expertise\nand diversity of its global workforce and its large network of suppliers and business partners, IBM considers itself well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities represented by the\nneeds of its clients and current trends in economics and society. IBM believes these trends will have major effects on business, government, education, healthcare, transportation and most other fields\nof endeavor. These developments include, in part: the globalization of capabilities, skills, and markets; the increasingly interconnected nature of companies, industries and even economies; the\ngrowing influence of open standards and open source software; the rise in collaborative models of creation and development; the maturation and availability of semiconductor and wireless chip\ntechnology; the use of service-oriented architectures and Web services in software development; the 1 growing\nnumber of service providers for a wider range of traditional and emerging business processes and functions; and the advances made by IBM and others in increasing computational speed, capacity\nand access. To\ncapitalize on the opportunities presented by these and other developments, and to avoid commoditization of its portfolio, IBM regularly reviews its businesses and invests in those\nthat represent strategic growth opportunities, reallocating resources as needed; it acquires businesses that contribute strategically to its portfolio; it exits or divests itself of businesses that no\nlonger support its strategy for innovation and higher value; and it seeks to improve productivity and drive efficiencies by integrating its global operations. IBM's\nstrategic priorities for 2006 include: \u2022 Capitalizing\non technological, business and social trends and the need of enterprises to innovate in addressing those trends; \u2022 Maintaining\nmarket-share leadership in systems, middleware software and services, as a platform to drive growth; \u2022 Focusing\ninvestment and resources on emerging growth areas, including Business Performance Transformation Services and emerging countries; \u2022 Continuing\nthe global integration of IBM, driving productivity gains and higher value in service delivery; \u2022 Furthering\nIBM's leadership in innovation initiatives, including advanced semiconductor design and development, collaborative intellectual capital, business process\nexpertise and integration, and advanced systems for supercomputing capability\u2014including mainframes and \"grid\" networks; \u2022 Acquiring\nbusinesses that contribute strategically to its portfolio, and exiting businesses that no longer support its strategy for innovation and higher value.

In addition, the group provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering technology services to clients and for IBM's own advanced\ntechnology needs. While appropriately not reported as external revenue, hardware is also deployed to support services solutions. 4 SOFTWARE\nconsists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and applications across their enterprises.\nMiddleware is designed to be the underlying support for applications provided by ISVs, who build industry- or process-specific applications according to open industry standards. Operating systems are\nthe engines that run computers. Approximately 45\u00a0percent of external Software revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements, whereby the client pays one up-front\npayment for a perpetual license. The remaining annuity-based revenue consists of both maintenance revenue sold with OTC arrangements, as well as revenue from software sold on a monthly license charge\n(MLC) arrangement. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product\nupgrades and technical support.

Primary product lines include\nproduct life cycle management software and document processing technologies. Product life cycle management software primarily serves the Industrial sector and helps clients manage the development and\nmanufacturing of their products. Document processor products service the Financial Services sector and include products that enable electronic banking. IBM Worldwide Organizations The following three company-wide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales\u00a0&\nDistribution Organization and related sales channels \u2022 Research,\nDevelopment and Intellectual Property \u2022 Integrated\nSupply Chain SALES\u00a0& DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION With a comprehensive knowledge of IBM's business and infrastructure solutions, as well as the products, technologies and services IBM and its Business Partners\noffer, the company's global client teams gain a deep understanding of each client's organizational, infrastructure and industry-specific needs to determine the best approach for addressing their\ncritical business and IT challenges. These professionals work in integrated teams with IBM consultants and technology representatives, combining their deep skills and expertise to deliver\nhigh-value solutions that address clients' pain points and innovational aspirations. The\nmajority of IBM's business, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors. The\ncompany's\ngo-to-market strategies and sales and distribution activities are organized around these sectors: \u2022 Financial\nServices: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public:\nEducation, Government, Healthcare and Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial:\nAerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution:\nConsumer Products, Retail, Travel, Transportation \u2022 Communications:\nTelecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 Small\nand Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees 5 Internal Routes-to-Market Services consultants focused on selling end-to-end solutions for large, complex business\nchallenges. Hardware and software brand specialists selling IBM products as parts of discrete technology decisions, and focusing on\nmid-sized clients interested in purchasing \"turnkey\" solutions, such as those in the IBM Express Portfolio. ibm.com provides fast, easy access to IBM's product and business expertise via the Web and telephone. Identifies business opportunities\nfor all of IBM's routes to market and provides online and telephone sales of standard hardware, software, services and financing for all size companies. Business Partners Routes-to-Market Global/major independent software vendors. ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications and, in doing so,\noften influence the sale of IBM hardware, middleware and services. Global/major systems integrators (SIS). SIS identify business problems and design solutions when IBM Global services is not\nthe preferred systems integrator; they also sell computing infrastructures from IBM and its competitors. Regional ISVs and SIS. SIS identify the business problems, and ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific\napplications to medium-sized and large businesses requiring IBM computing infrastructure offerings. Solutions providers, resellers and distributors. Resellers sell IBM platforms and value-added services as part of a discrete\ntechnology platform decision to clients wanting third-party assistance. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate IBM from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $5\u2013$6\u00a0billion for\nR&D, including capitalized software costs, focusing its investments in high-growth opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S.\npatents in 2005 than any other company. This marks the 13th year in a row that IBM achieved this distinction. In\naddition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing\nservices activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income. Some of IBM's\ntechnological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are used by the company's licensees for their products when that new technology is not strategic to IBM's business goals.\nA third group is both used internally and licensed externally. In\naddition to these IP income sources, the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through cross-licensing arrangements and IP licensed in divestiture transactions. The\nvalue of these other two sources is not readily apparent in the financial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings, because income on cross-licensing arrangements is recorded only to the extent\nthat cash is received. The value received by IBM for IP involving the sale of a business is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture, not in the separately displayed IP income amounts\nin financial results and Consolidated Statement of Earnings. 6 INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to market conditions, the company continues to see business\nvalue as it establishes its globally integrated supply chain as an on demand business, transforming this function into a strategic advantage for the company and, ultimately, improved delivery and\noutcomes for its clients. Leveraging this experience, in June 2005, IBM launched its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help run clients'\nend-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to logistics. IBM\nspends approximately $38\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and logistics and\ncustomer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable\ncosts. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations and sales force productivity and processes and thereby the experiences of the company's clients when working with IBM.\nBecause some of the cost savings this unit generates are passed along to clients, they will not always result in a visible gross margin improvement in the company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\nWhile these efforts are largely concerned with product manufacturing and delivery, IBM is also applying supply-chain principles to service delivery across its solutions and services lines of business. In\naddition to its own manufacturing operations, the company uses a number of contract manufacturing (CM) companies around the world to manufacture IBM-designed products. The\nuse of CM companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time-to-market for certain IBM products. Some of the company's relationships with CM companies are\nexclusive. The company has key relationships with Sanmina-SCI for the manufacture of some Intel-based products and with Solectron for a significant portion of the manufacturing operations\nof Global Asset Recovery Services\u2014an operation of Global Financing that restores end-of-lease personal computers and other IT equipment for resale.

Risk Factors: Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets: If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether\ndue to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse portfolio of products and offerings is designed to gain market share in\nstrong and weak economic climates. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams as well as cyclical transaction-based sales,\nbut also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends,\nfocusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives: IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility\nand cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In 2005, the company realigned its operations and organizational structure in Europe to give sales\nand delivery teams greater authority, accountability and flexibility to make decisions and to execute more effectively on behalf of our clients. Additionally, in 2005, many of the company's corporate\nfunctions\u2014such as Legal, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology, and Real Estate Site Operations\u2014which had been previously replicated for many of the individual\ncountries where IBM operates were integrated so that they could be managed and their resources optimized on a global scale. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive\nproductivity, this integration improves IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on\nlearning, development and knowledge sharing. Innovation Initiatives: IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research\nand development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies, and other institutions.\nTo deliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can\ndifferentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. Examples include IBM's leadership position in the design and fabrication of ASICs; the design of smaller, faster and\nenergy-efficient semiconductor devices; the design of \"grid\" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power; the transformation and integration of business processes; and the\ncompany's efforts to advance open technology standards and to engage with governments, academia, think tanks and nongovernmental organizations on emerging trends in technology, society and culture. In\nthe highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single-technology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is\ncritical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its R&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs, as discussed in Description\nof Business\u2014IBM Worldwide Organizations. 8 Open Standards: The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a\nsignificant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications\nand processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards\u2014rather than closed, proprietary architectures\u2014also allows the computing\ninfrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and\nbecause their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in the IT industry with significant resources and\ninvestments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition will result in increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims\nand proceedings. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, and the development of Rational software development tools, which\ncan be used to develop and upgrade any other company's software products. Investing in Growth Opportunities: The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of\nenterprise computing\u2014providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth\nopportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gain. Areas of investment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client and industry-specific\nsolutions, Business Performance Transformation Services, key technologies and emerging growth countries such as China, Russia, India and Brazil. Protection of Intellectual Property: While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to\nits success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any\nparticular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under\npatents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services\nsimilar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be\nno assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Seasonality of Revenues: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products, the length of the\nsales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter\nthan in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. Local Legal, Economic and Health Conditions: The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derives more than\nhalf of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the\ncompany's results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and\ninflation. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (bird flu) or any other pandemic, or local or\nglobal health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations, its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers, and customer demand. Insurance: The company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss.\nWhile we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the\ncoverage provided by such arrangements. 9 Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning\nthe discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,\nfines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance\nwith environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position. Tax Matters: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's\nprovision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in\ncountries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is\nsubject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting\nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on\nthe company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Internal Controls: Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to\nits financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's brand and\noperating results could be harmed. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including\nmanagement's assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the\npossibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and\nfair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the\ncontrol may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its\ninternal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating\nresults could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. Use of Estimates: In connection with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company uses certain\nestimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future. The company's most critical\naccounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion on pages\u00a040 to 42 of IBM's 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders. In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0O, \"Contingencies and\nCommitments\" on pages\u00a076 to 79 of IBM's 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under SFAS No.\u00a05 \"Accounting for Contingencies\", including decisions\nrelated to legal proceedings and reserves. While management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they involve the use of judgment and the\nexercise of discretion, and therefore actual results may differ. Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's\nbusinesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from 10 Fortune\n50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality,\nreliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. Intense\ncompetitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of\nits competitors, the company has a broad portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product\nlines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and\nmarketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. Volatility of Stock Price: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in\nfinancial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the\ncompany's stock price is subject to significant volatility. Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service\nand availability of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense. There can be no assurance that IBM will be able to successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. In addition, companies in the information technology and services\nindustry whose employees accept positions with IBM may claim that IBM has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of\nthese persons by IBM would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. Any such claims could limit or prevent IBM from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial\ncosts in defending the company or its employees against these claims, whether or not they\nhave merit. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the\ncompany's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw\nmaterials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to assure\nthat alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely\nmanner could adversely affect the company's business. Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from\nits affiliates operating in local currency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the\ncompany's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk and the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and\nliabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the\nrisk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be successful. Customer Credit Risk on Trade Receivables: The company's diversified client base includes a large number of worldwide\nenterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations, companies and governments. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis 11 and\nthe company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. The company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible trade\nreceivables and regularly reviews such reserves by considering factors such as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. Customer credit risk is\nmitigated due to the large number of clients constituting the company's worldwide client base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. If the company becomes aware of\nadditional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may\nhave to adjust its reserves, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and\nresellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from\ntime to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will\nmanage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the\nfailure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company issues debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to\ntime, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of our debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including changes in interest rates, the methods employed\nfor calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and\nvolatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations, and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The\ncompany's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under\nItem\u00a01A entitled \"Risk Factors\". There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under Item\u00a01A entitled \"Risk Factors\", including the section entitled \"Volatility of Stock Price\", as well as\neconomic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about our financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the\ncompany's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. The company\ndoes not make a market in either its debt or equity securities, and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. 12 Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2005, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 22\u00a0million square feet, of\nwhich 17\u00a0million was owned and 5\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts,\u00a03\u00a0million square feet was vacant and\u00a01\u00a0million square feet was being leased to\nnon-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 8\u00a0other countries totaled 9\u00a0million square feet, of which\u00a03\u00a0million was owned and 6\u00a0million was leased. Of\nthese amounts, 1 million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous upgrading of facilities is\nessential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity, and meet customer demand.

These statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on these statements based on our audits. We\nconducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company\u00a0Accounting Oversight Board (United\u00a0States). Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and\ndisclosures in the statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nstatements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. The\nstatements were prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (for use by the Company in connection with its various\nfilings with the Commission). Certain corporate assets, liabilities and corporate expenses, that are not the responsibility of the Reporting Unit, and which have not been allocated, have been excluded\nfrom the statements. Accordingly, these statements are not intended to be a complete presentation of the financial position or results of operations of the Reporting Unit. In\nour opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the assets and liabilities of the Reporting Unit as of December\u00a031, 2004 and its\nrevenues and expenses for the years ended December\u00a031, 2004 and 2003, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. /s/ Ernst\u00a0& Young LLP ERNST\u00a0& YOUNG LLP New York, New York February\u00a022, 2005 22 SCHEDULE II INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS AND RESERVES For the Years Ended December\u00a031: (Dollars in Millions) Description Balance at Beginning of Period Additions Charged to Costs and Expenses Writeoffs Other(A) Balance at End of Period Allowance For Doubtful Accounts 2005 \u2014Current $ 971 $ 15 $ 215 $ (75 ) $ 696 \u2014Noncurrent $ 97 $ (24 ) $ 14 $ 4 $ 63 2004 \u2014Current $ 1,100 $ 115 $ 296 $ 52 $ 971 \u2014Noncurrent $ 119 $ 14 $ 43 $ 7 $ 97 2003 \u2014Current $ 1,312 $ 158 $ 476 $ 106 $ 1,100 \u2014Noncurrent $ 109 $ 49 $ 39 $ \u2014 $ 119 Allowance For Inventory Losses 2005 $ 655 $ 307 $ 290 $ (31 ) $ 641 2004 $ 721 $ 327 $ 428 $ 35 $ 655 2003 $ 696 $ 407 $ 442 $ 60 $ 721 Revenue Based Provisions 2005 $ 1,048 $ 4,762 $ 4,887 $ (43 ) $ 880 2004 $ 1,088 $ 5,184 $ 5,247 $ 23 $ 1,048 2003 $ 995 $ 4,905 $ 4,853 $ 41 $ 1,088 (A) Primarily\ncomprises currency translation adjustments.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New\nYork. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over\n80\u00a0years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is a globally integrated innovation\ncompany, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon\nthe world's leading systems, software and services capabilities. *\n* * Description of Business IBM is a globally integrated innovation company, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. The company seeks to be a partner in its clients'\nsuccess by enabling their own capacity to innovate, so that they may differentiate themselves for competitive advantage in a globalized economy. IBM views enterprise innovation not only in terms of\nproducts and services, but across all dimensions of a business: its business processes, business model, management systems, culture and role in society. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness,\nefficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon the world's leading systems, software and services capabilities. IBM's Strategy The company has divested low growth commoditizing product lines and acquired higher value opportunities to leverage IBM's infrastructure. In\nIBM's view, the future of business is being shaped by the forces of global integration and innovation. They are foundational and intimately related to one another. A globally\nintegrated enterprise is a new institutional form that shapes its strategy, management and operations globally, based on economics, expertise and open business environments. It is optimized for\ninnovation in a worldwide economy and society that are increasingly integrated and specialized. IBM's strategic moves over the past several years\u2014from divestitures and acquisitions, to\nareas of focus for innovation, to the transformation of its core lines of business\u2014have been shaped by this vision. 1 IBM's\nstrategic priorities to pursue this vision include: \u2022 Offering\nenterprises in the global economy innovative, high-value solutions based on IBM's ability to integrate technology and business model innovation to deliver\nmeasurable results for IBM and its clients; \u2022 Leading\nin the delivery of business value by providing business and information technology consulting and implementation services; building, running and maintaining\ncross-industry and industry-specific business process services; leveraging leadership technology and engineering services; and accelerating increased business value through Service Oriented\nArchitectures (SOA) and Information on Demand; \u2022 Leading\nin the delivery of advanced infrastructure through enterprise SOA and infrastructure software and services; increased share leadership in servers; driving to\nleadership in storage; and leading the transition to standardized services offerings; and \u2022 Making\nIBM the premier Globally Integrated Enterprise \u2014 lowering costs and increasing effectiveness by integrating\nthe company's decision-making at the point of client contact (\"lowering IBM's center of gravity\"); moving work to where it can best be performed; focusing IBM's resources to create the greatest value;\nand excelling in business collaboration. IBM's Capabilities To execute its strategy, IBM's business comprises three principal business segments: \u2022 Systems\nand Financing \u2022 Software \u2022 Services 2 SYSTEMS AND FINANCING Systems Servers. IBM systems using IBM operating systems (System z and System i), as well as AIX, the IBM UNIX operating system\n(System p and BladeCenter) and the Microsoft Windows operating system (System x and BladeCenter).

Business Segments Organizationally, the company's major operations comprise a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Systems and Technology Group\nsegment; a Software segment; and a Global Financing segment. GLOBAL SERVICES is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing insight and solutions to clients. While solutions often\ninclude industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Contracts for IBM services\u2014commonly referred to as\n\"signings\"\u2014can range from less than one year to over ten years. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) segment primarily reflects infrastructure services, delivering value through the company's global scale,\nstandardization and automation. It includes outsourcing services, Integrated Technology Services and Maintenance. Global Business Services (GBS) segment primarily reflects professional services, delivering business value and innovation to clients\nthrough solutions which leverage industry and business process expertise. It includes consulting, systems integration and Application Management Services. SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY GROUP provides IBM's clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities.\nApproximately 55\u00a0percent of the Systems and Technology Group's server and storage sales transactions are through business partners; approximately 45\u00a0percent are direct to\nend-user clients, more than half of which are through the Web at ibm.com. In addition, the group provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering\ntechnology services to clients and for IBM's own advanced technology needs. While not reported as external revenue, hardware is also deployed to support services solutions. 4 SOFTWARE consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,\nprocesses and applications across a standard software platform. IBM Middleware is designed to open standards which allows the efficient integration of disparate client applications that may have been\nbuilt internally, or provided by package software vendors or system integrators. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. In addition, Software includes Product Lifecycle\nManagement software which primarily serves the Industrial sector. Approximately 25\u00a0percent of software transactions are sold through business partners. Also, 50\u00a0percent of external\nSoftware revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements, whereby the client pays one up-front payment for a perpetual license. The remaining annuity-based revenue\nconsists of both maintenance revenue sold with OTC arrangements, as well as revenue from software sold on a recurring license charge arrangement. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software\ninclude one year of maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. While not reported as external revenue,\nsoftware is also deployed to support services solutions. GLOBAL FINANCING is described on pages 49 through 53 in IBM's 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders. IBM Worldwide Organizations The following three company-wide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales\u00a0&\nDistribution Organization and related sales channels \u2022 Research,\nDevelopment and Intellectual Property \u2022 Integrated\nSupply Chain SALES\u00a0& DISTRIBUTION ORGANIZATION With a comprehensive knowledge of IBM's business and infrastructure solutions, as well as the products, technologies and services IBM and its business partners\noffer, the company's global client teams gain a deep understanding of each client's organizational, infrastructure and industry-specific needs to determine the best approach for addressing their\ncritical business and IT challenges. These professionals work in integrated teams with IBM consultants and technology representatives, combining their deep skills and expertise to deliver\nhigh-value solutions that address clients' pain points and innovational aspirations. To\nfacilitate its access to clients and local markets and to improve productivity, the Sales and Distribution organization utilizes geographic organizations in the Americas,\nEurope/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific geographies. This structure enables resources and decision making to be closer to the clients. The\nmajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors: \u2022 Financial\nServices: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public:\nEducation, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial:\nAerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution:\nConsumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation \u2022 Communications:\nTelecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 Small\nand Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees 5 Internal Routes-to-Market Services consultants focused on selling end-to-end solutions for large, complex business\nchallenges. Hardware and software brand specialists selling IBM products as parts of discrete technology decisions and as part of broader client\nsolutions. ibm.com provides fast, easy access to IBM's product and business expertise via the Web and telephone. In addition, ibm.com identifies\nbusiness opportunities for all of IBM's routes to market and provides online and telephone sales of standard hardware, software, services and financing for all size companies. Business Partners Routes-to-Market Global/major independent software vendors (ISVs). ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications\nand, in doing so, often influence the sale of IBM hardware, middleware and services. Global/major systems integrators (SIs). SIs identify business problems and design solutions when IBM Global Services is not the preferred\nsystems integrator; they also sell computing infrastructures from IBM and its competitors. Regional ISVs and SIs. SIs identify the business problems, and ISVs deliver business process or industry-specific applications to\nmedium-sized and large businesses requiring IBM computing infrastructure offerings. Solutions providers, resellers and distributors. Resellers sell IBM platforms and value-added services as part of a discrete technology\nplatform decision to clients wanting third-party assistance. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate IBM from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $6\u00a0billion for R&D, focusing its\ninvestments in high-growth, high-value opportunities. In 2006, the company's investment in R&D was approximately\u00a015\u00a0percent of its combined hardware and software\nrevenue. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2006 than any other company. This marks the 14th year in a row that IBM achieved this\ndistinction. In\naddition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing\nservices activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1\u00a0billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used\nexclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. In\naddition to these IP income sources, the company also generates value from its patent portfolio through cross-licensing arrangements and IP licensed in divestiture transactions. The\nvalue of these transactions is not readily apparent in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, because income on cross-licensing arrangements is recorded only to the extent that cash is received. The\nvalue received for IP involving the sale of a business is included in the overall gain or loss from the divestiture, not in the separately presented IP income amounts on the Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings. INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global market conditions, the company continues to derive\nbusiness value from its own globally integrated supply chain, reinvented as a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients and shareholders. IBM leverages its supply chain expertise\nfor clients through its supply-chain business 6 transformation\noutsourcing service to optimize and help run clients' end-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to logistics. IBM\nspends approximately $36\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and logistics and\ncustomer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable\ncosts. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations and sales force productivity and processes and these actions have improved client satisfaction when working with the\ncompany. Since some of the cost savings this unit generates are passed along to clients, they will not always result in a visible gross margin improvement in the company's Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings. IBM is continuing to apply the supply-chain principles of product manufacturing and delivery to service delivery across its solutions and services lines of business. In\naddition to its own manufacturing operations, the company uses a number of contract manufacturing (CM) companies around the world to manufacture IBM-designed products. The\nuse of CM companies is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time-to-market for certain IBM products. Key Business Drivers The following are some of the key drivers of the company's business. ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CORPORATE SPENDING BUDGETS If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales\nperformance could be impacted. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent results in both strong and weak economic environments. The company accomplishes this\nby not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and\neffectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client- or industry-specific solutions, business performance\nand open standards. INTERNAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION AND GLOBAL INTEGRATION INITIATIVES IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In\n2006, the company continued the global integration of its internal support functions\u2014such as Legal, Finance, Human Resources, Information Technology and Real Estate Site\nOperations\u2014which had been previously replicated for many of the individual countries where IBM operates. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive\nproductivity, this integration has improved IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and led to a sharper focus for the company on\nlearning, development and knowledge sharing. The company will continue to focus on global integration initiatives to improve productivity in its integrated supply chain, service delivery and internal\nsupport functions. INNOVATION INITIATIVES IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as in\nthe establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. Examples include IBM's leadership position in the design and\nfabrication of game processors; the design of smaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; and the design of \"grid\" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power. 7 Through\nthe Global Innovation Outlook (GIO), IBM has opened up its technical and business forecasting processes to include external leaders from business, academia, the public sector,\nnongovernmental organizations and other influential constituents of the world community. The GIO takes a deep look at some of the most pressing issues facing the world and works toward providing\nsolutions to those needs. In 2006, IBM also announced that it will invest $100\u00a0million over the next two years to pursue ten new businesses generated by InnovationJam, an on-line\nbrainstorming session which brought together more than 150,000 people from 104 countries, including IBM employees, family members, universities, business partners and clients from 67 companies. Over\ntwo 72-hour sessions, participants posted more than 46,000 ideas as they explored IBM's most advanced research technologies and considered their application to real-world\nproblems and emerging business opportunities. OPEN STANDARDS The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for an on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across\nall industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task.\nThe broad-based acceptance of open standards\u2014rather than closed, proprietary architectures\u2014also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit\nfrom) new technical innovations. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, and the development of Rational software\ndevelopment tools, which can be used to develop and upgrade other companies' software products. INVESTING IN GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing\u2014providing technology and transformation\nservices to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Areas of\ninvestment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client- and industry-specific solutions, maintaining technology leadership and emerging growth countries such as\nChina, Russia, India and Brazil.

Risk Factors: Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets: If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether\ndue to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent\nresults in both strong and weak economic environments. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical\ntransaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of\nshifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives: IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility\nand cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this\nintegration has improved IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on learning,\ndevelopment and knowledge sharing. As IBM continues to drive higher levels of automation and integration into its business, IBM's dependency on internal IT systems also increases. Innovation Initiatives: IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research\nand development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. To\ndeliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can\ndifferentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. In the highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single\ntechnology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its\nR&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs. Open Standards: The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a\nsignificant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications\nand processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards\u2014rather than closed, proprietary architectures\u2014also allows the computing\ninfrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and\nbecause their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in\nthe IT industry with significant resources and investments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition will result\nin increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims and proceedings. Investing in Growth Opportunities: The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of\nenterprise computing\u2014providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth\nopportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. IBM continues to invest in emerging growth countries such as China, Russia, India and Brazil. The developing nature of these\ncountries presents political, social and economic risks to IBM's business, including the potential for inadequate infrastructure and labor disruptions. Protection of Intellectual Property: While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to\nits success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on 10 any\nparticular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under\npatents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These protections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services\nsimilar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be\nno assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Seasonality of Revenues and Purchases: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and\nservices, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower\nrevenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter,\nmay affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. Local Legal, Economic and Health Conditions: The company operates in more than 160 countries worldwide and derived more than\nhalf of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the company's business in that country and the\ncompany's results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions and\ninflation. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (bird flu) or any other pandemic, or local or\nglobal health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations, its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers and customer demand. Insurance: The company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss.\nWhile we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the\ncoverage provided by such arrangements. Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning\nthe discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,\nfines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance\nwith environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position. Tax Matters: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's\nprovision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in\ncountries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is\nsubject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting\nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on\nthe company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. 11 Internal Controls: Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to\nits financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's operating\nresults could be affected. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's\nassessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of\nhuman error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair\npresentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the\ncontrol may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its\ninternal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating\nresults could be harmed, the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. Use of Estimates: In connection with the application of GAAP and the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements,\nthe company uses certain estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the company may undertake in the future. The\ncompany's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion on pages 45 to 47 of IBM's 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders. In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0O,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments\" on pages 89 to 92 of IBM's 2006 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of SFAS No.\u00a05 \"Accounting for\nContingencies\", including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. While management believes that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, by definition they\ninvolve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion, and therefore, actual results may differ. Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's\nbusinesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company\nbelieves that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors. Intense competitive pressures\ncould affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike many of its competitors, the company has a broad\nset of capabilities and businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As a result, the company\nmay not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources available to them\nthan the businesses against which they compete. Volatility of Stock Price: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in\nfinancial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the\ncompany's stock price is subject to significant volatility. Dependence on and Compensation of Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service,\navailability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand and competition for\ntheir talents is intense. There can be no assurance that IBM will be 12 able\nto successfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs. In addition, companies in the information technology and services industry whose employees accept positions with IBM may claim that\nIBM has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged in unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons by IBM would involve the disclosure or use of trade\nsecrets. Any such claims could limit or prevent IBM from hiring employees or cause it to incur liability for damages or substantial costs in defending the company or its employees against these\nclaims, whether or not they have merit. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other\nfactors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw\nmaterials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to\nassure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a\ntimely manner could adversely affect the company's business. Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its non-U.S. revenues from\nits affiliates operating in local currency environments and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in\nthe company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit risk, the creditworthiness of the client, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt,\nliabilities and the determination of residual values, and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of\nderivative financial instruments. Derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these\nrisks will be successful. Customer Credit Risk on Trade Receivables: The company's diversified client base includes a large number of worldwide\nenterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations, companies and governments. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing\ncredit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. The company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible trade receivables and regularly reviews\nsuch reserves by considering factors such as write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. Customer credit risk is mitigated due to the large number of\nclients constituting the company's worldwide client base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographies. If the company becomes aware of additional information related to the\ncredit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves, which\ncould affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and\nresellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from\ntime to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will\nmanage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the\nfailure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. 13 Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company issues debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to\ntime, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of our debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including changes in interest rates, the methods employed\nfor calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and\nvolatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's\nability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under Item 1A. entitled\n\"Risk Factors\". There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under Item 1A. entitled \"Risk Factors\", including the section entitled \"Volatility of Stock Price\", as well as economic\nand geopolitical\nconditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about our financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the\nmarket price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities. The company\ndoes not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2006, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 20\u00a0million square feet, of\nwhich 16\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts,\u00a02\u00a0million square feet was vacant and\u00a01\u00a0million square feet was being leased to\nnon-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 8\u00a0other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which\u00a03\u00a0million was owned and 3\u00a0million was leased. Of\nthese amounts, 1\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

The company has issued\n57,918 shares of IBM common stock under the DCEAP through 2006, and 705,196 shares remain available for issuance thereunder. The\nmaterial features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN The 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"2001 Plan\") is used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company. Awards for\nsenior executives of the company will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"1999 Plan\"). Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are\nidentical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of 17 awards\nthat may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards). The\n2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, and that committee may delegate to officers of the Company\ncertain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with committee approval. Awards are not transferable\nor assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the committee. If\nthe employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be canceled\nimmediately, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits\nunder the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may\nbe, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable Award Agreement.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New\nYork. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over\n80\u00a0years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: IBM is a globally integrated innovation\ncompany, serving the needs of enterprises and institutions worldwide. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon\nthe world's leading systems, software and services capabilities. *\n* * Description of Business IBM is a globally integrated enterprise that targets the intersection of technology and effective business. The company seeks to be a partner in its clients'\nsuccess by enabling their own capacity for distinctive innovation. To help clients achieve growth, effectiveness, efficiency and the realization of greater value through innovation, IBM draws upon the\nworld's leading systems, software and services capabilities. IBM'S STRATEGY In IBM's view, today's networked economy has created a global business landscape and a mandate for business change. Integrated global economies have opened\nmarkets of new opportunity and new sources of skills. The Internet has enabled communication and collaboration across the world and brought with it a new computing model premised on continuous global\nconnection. In that landscape, companies can distribute work and technology anywhere in the world. Given\nthese opportunities, IBM is working with its clients to develop new business designs and technical architectures that allow their businesses the flexibility required to compete in\nthis new landscape. The business is also adjusting its footprint towards emerging geographies, tapping their double-digit growth, providing the technology infrastructure they need, and taking\nadvantage of the talent pools they provide to better service the company's clients. IBM's\nstrategy addresses this new era and delivers value to its clients through three strategic priorities: Focus on Open Technologies and High-Value Solutions The PC era has ended, representing a fundamental shift in the technology requirements of the company's clients. IBM is well positioned to provide its enterprise\nclients the open technologies and high-value solutions they will need to compete. \u2022 IBM is leveraging its leadership position in the convergence of software and services, in SOA, in virtualization, in high-performance\nchips, in open and modular IT\u2014continuing its shift from commoditizing segments to higher value segments with better profit opportunity. \u2022 The company continues to be a leading force in open source solutions to enable its clients to achieve higher levels of interoperability, cost\nefficiency and quality. 1 Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients Changes in the market have caused IBM's clients to seek flexibility and innovation in everything from technical architecture to their business model. In response,\nIBM is focused on delivering integration and innovation to its clients\u2014offering them technologies and services that support real value creation. \u2022 IBM has a long heritage of transforming the business operations of large enterprises and has earned the trust to be their innovation partner and\nglobal integrator. \u2022 The company has a deep set of global assets and capabilities it is applying to improve services profitability, both for its clients and for\nitself. Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise As global networks and technology capabilities change business economics, legacy business designs can quickly become non-competitive. IBM believes a\nglobally integrated enterprise, designed for this new landscape can compete effectively and will benefit from the opportunities offered. \u2022 To reshape its business for the global economy, IBM has replaced vertical hierarchies with horizontally integrated teams. \u2022 Across the business, the company has made significant investments in emerging markets, taking core processes and functions that were once managed\nregionally and shifting them to a globally integrated model. Looking\nforward, IBM is confident it understands the economic shift of globalization, the evolution of the new computing model and the powerful role of innovation in this new landscape.\nIts unique\ncapabilities are well adapted to help the company's clients innovate and compete effectively in the new landscape. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES The company's major operations comprise a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Systems and Technology segment; a Software\nsegment; and a Global Financing segment. 2 Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to clients. While\nsolutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Contracts for IBM services\u2014commonly referred\nto as \"signings\"\u2014can range from less than one year to over ten years. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) segment primarily reflects IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering value through the\ncompany's global scale, standardization and automation. GTS Capabilities Strategic Outsourcing Services. Comprehensive IT services integrated with business insight working with clients to reduce\ncosts and improve productivity through the outsourcing of processes and operations. Business Transformation Outsourcing. A range of offerings from standardized processing platforms and Business Process\nOutsourcing through transformational offerings that delivers improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications and\ninfrastructure. Integrated Technology Services. Services offerings that help clients access, manage and support their technology\ninfrastructures, through a combination of skilled resources, software and IBM's knowledge of business processes. Maintenance. A number of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain and improve the\navailability of clients' IT infrastructure. Global Business Services (GBS) segment primarily reflects professional services and application outsourcing services, delivering business value and\ninnovation to clients through solutions which leverage industry- and business-process expertise. GBS Capabilities Consulting and Systems Integration. Delivery of value to clients through consulting services for client-relationship\nmanagement, financial management, human capital management, business strategy and change, and supply-chain management. Application Management Services. Application development, management, maintenance and support services for packaged software,\nas well as custom and legacy applications. Delivering value through the company's global resource capabilities, industry knowledge, and the standardization and automation of application development. Systems and Technology segment provides IBM's clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities. Approximately\n55\u00a0percent of the Systems and Technology's server and storage sales transactions are through the company's business partners; approximately 45\u00a0percent are direct to end-user\nclients, more than 40\u00a0percent of which are through the\nInternet at ibm.com. In addition, Systems and Technology provides leading semiconductor technology and products, packaging solutions and engineering technology services to clients and for IBM's own\nadvanced technology needs. While not reported as external revenue, systems hardware is also deployed to support services solutions. 3 Systems and Technology Capabilities Servers. IBM systems, which are typically connected to a network and provide the required infrastructure for business. These\nsystems use both IBM and non-IBM operating systems and all IBM servers can also run Linux, a key open source operating system. (System\u00a0z, System\u00a0i, System\u00a0p,\nSystem\u00a0x and BladeCenter). Storage. Information infrastructure products and solutions, which address critical client requirements for information\nretention and archiving, availability and virtualization, and security and compliance. The portfolio consists of a broad range of disk and tape storage systems and software. Microelectronics.

Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and\napplications across a standard software platform. IBM middleware is designed to open standards which allows the efficient integration of disparate client applications that may have been built\ninternally, or provided by package software vendors or system integrators. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. In addition, Software\nincludes Product Lifecycle Management software which primarily serves the Industrial sector. Approximately two-thirds of external software segment revenue is annuity-based, coming from\nrecurring license charges and on-going subscription and support from one-time charge (OTC) arrangements. The remaining one-third of external revenue relates to OTC\narrangements, in which the client pays one up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of maintenance. The client can\nalso purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. While not reported as external revenue, software is also deployed to support services\nsolutions. Software Capabilites WebSphere Software. Management of a wide variety of business processes using open standards to interconnect applications,\ndata and operating systems. Provides the foundation for Web-enabled applications and is a key product set in deploying a Services Oriented Architecture. Information Management Software.

Lease and loan financing to external and internal clients for terms generally between two and seven years. Remarketing. The sale and lease of used equipment (primarily sourced from the conclusion of lease transactions) to new or\nexisting clients. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution Organization \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Integrated Operations Sales and Distribution Organization The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country based operating units focused on delivering client\nvalue. Within these units, client relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance.\nThese teams deliver value by understanding the client's business and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop and implement\nsolutions for clients. By\ncombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and\ntimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by leveraging\nindustry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources. The\nmajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six sectors: \u2022 Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation \u2022 Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 Small and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees 5 Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately $6\u00a0billion for R&D,\nfocusing its investments in high-growth, high-value opportunities. In 2007, the company's investment in R&D was approximately 15\u00a0percent of its combined hardware and\nsoftware revenue. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2007 than any other company. This marks the 15th year in a row that IBM achieved\nthis distinction. In\naddition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its growing\nservices activities. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1\u00a0billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used\nexclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. INTEGRATED OPERATIONS IBM's ability to deliver differentiating innovation to its clients is being greatly enhanced by the company's global integration which is simultaneously giving\nthe company better economics and deeper capabilities, while eliminating redundancies that were built up over fifty years as a growing multinational enterprise. The company operates in 170 countries,\nwith approximately 69\u00a0percent of its employees outside the U.S. As a globally integrated enterprise, the company organizes work based on the right costs, the right skills and the right business\nenvironment, integrating deeply with its partners, suppliers and clients. Being global is about gaining access to talent and skills and then scaling them globally to develop new, distinctive\ncapabilities. The company's integrated operations enable IBM to be the most efficient, responsive and globally integrated enterprise\u2014able to instantly leverage its expertise and\ncapabilities\u2014anywhere, at any time. Although bound by a common mission and principles, Integrated Operations is comprised of three distinct units, each with very specific objectives\nclosely aligned with the IBM businesses they support. Integrated Supply Chain Just as IBM works to transform its clients' supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global market conditions, the company continues to derive\nbusiness value from its own globally integrated supply chain, reinvented as a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients and shareholders. IBM leverages its supply-chain expertise\nfor clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply-chain processes, from procurement to\nlogistics. IBM\nspends approximately $38\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services around the world. The company's supply, manufacturing and logistics and\ncustomer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has reduced inventories, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed to variable\ncosts. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes, and these actions have improved client satisfaction. Integrated Technology Delivery Integrated Technology Delivery (ITD) brings together all of the company's worldwide service delivery capabilities for Strategic Outsourcing with strong local and\nregional management teams supported by a set of global competencies. ITD leverages the company's global scale and advanced technology to deliver standardized solutions that are automated, repeatable\nand globally integrated. 6 Through\nthe company's global position, clients gain cost advantages, access to industry-leading skills and access to IBM's scale and overall flexibility. ITD manages the world's largest\nprivately-owned IT infrastructure with employees in over 30 countries supporting over 400\u00a0data centers. Integrated Managed Business Process Delivery Integrated Managed Business Process Delivery (IMBPD) provides highly efficient, world class delivery capabilities in IBM's business process delivery operations,\nwhich include Business Transformation Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing, Business Process Services and Application on Demand. IMBPD has employees and delivery centers in over 40 countries\nworldwide. KEY BUSINESS DRIVERS The following are some of the key drivers of the company's business. Economic Environment and Corporate Spending Budgets Global demand for systems, software and services is a key driver of the company's business and financial performance. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings\nis designed to provide more consistent results in both strong and weak economic environments. The company accomplishes this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and\nincome streams, as well as cyclical transaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to\ntransform itself to take advantage of shifting demand trends, focusing on client- or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives IBM is committed to its transformation to a globally integrated enterprise. The company continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by\ntransforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this integration has improved\nIBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and led to a sharper focus for the company on learning, development and knowledge sharing. Innovation Initiatives IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research and development of new products and services, as well as in\nthe establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. Examples include IBM's leadership positions in the design of\nsmaller, faster and energy-efficient semiconductor devices; systems virtualization, Green Data Centers and the design of \"grid\" computing networks that allow computers to share processing power. Open Standards The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for an on demand business and is a significant driver of collaborative innovation across\nall industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications and processes remains a monumental and expensive task.\nThe broad-based acceptance of open standards\u2014rather than closed, proprietary architectures\u2014also allows the computing infrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit\nfrom) new technical innovations. IBM's support of open standards is evidenced by the enabling of its products to support open standards such as Linux, 7 and\nthe development of Rational software development tools, which can be used to develop and upgrade other companies' software products. Investing in Growth Opportunities The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher value segments of enterprise computing\u2014providing technology and transformation\nservices to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth opportunities as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Areas of\ninvestment include strategic acquisitions, primarily in software and services, focused client- and industry-specific solutions, maintaining technology leadership and emerging growth countries\nworldwide.

Risk Factors: Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets: If overall demand for systems, software and services changes, whether\ndue to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, sales performance could be impacted. IBM's diverse set of products and offerings is designed to provide more consistent\nresults in both strong and weak economic environments. The company addresses this by not only having a mix of offerings with long-term cash and income streams, as well as cyclical\ntransaction-based sales, but also by continually developing competitive products and solutions and effectively managing a skilled resource base. IBM continues to transform itself to take advantage of\nshifting demand trends, focusing on client or industry-specific solutions, business performance and open standards. Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives: IBM continues to drive greater productivity, flexibility\nand cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and functions. In addition to eliminating redundancies and overhead structures to drive productivity, this\nintegration has improved IBM's capacity to innovate by providing greater clarity of key priorities around shared goals and objectives and leads to a sharper focus for the company on learning,\ndevelopment and knowledge sharing. As IBM continues to drive higher levels of automation and integration into its business, IBM's dependency on internal IT systems also increases. Innovation Initiatives: IBM invests to improve its ability to help its clients innovate. Investment may occur in the research\nand development of new products and services, as well as in the establishment of new collaborative and co-creation relationships with developers, other companies and other institutions. To\ndeliver value that helps clients differentiate themselves for competitive advantage, IBM has been moving away from commoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can\ndifferentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. In the highly competitive IT industry, with large diversified competitors as well as smaller and nimble single\ntechnology competitors, IBM's ability to continue its cutting-edge innovation is critical to maintaining and increasing market share. IBM is managing this risk by more closely linking its\nR&D organization to industry-specific and client-specific needs. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation depends in part on its ability\nto continue to stand for industry-leading technology and solutions that provide business advantages. Open Standards: The broad adoption of open standards is essential to the computing model for on demand business and is a\nsignificant driver of collaborative innovation across all industries. Without interoperability among all manner of computing platforms, the integration of any client's internal systems, applications\nand processes remains a monumental and expensive task. The broad-based acceptance of open standards\u2014rather than closed, proprietary architectures\u2014also allows the computing\ninfrastructure to more easily absorb (and thus benefit from) new technical innovations. IBM is committed to fostering open standards because they are vital to the On Demand Operating Environment, and\nbecause their acceptance will expand growth opportunities across the entire business services and IT industry. There are a number of competitors in the IT industry with significant resources and\ninvestments who are committed to closed and proprietary platforms as a way to lock customers into a particular architecture. This competition may result in increased pricing pressure and/or IP claims\nand proceedings. Investing in Growth Opportunities: The company is continuing to refocus its business on the higher-value segments of\nenterprise computing\u2014providing technology and transformation services to clients' businesses. Consistent with that focus, the company continues to significantly invest in growth\nopportunities, as a way to drive revenue growth and market share gains. IBM continues to invest in dozens of emerging growth countries including Brazil, Russia, India and China. The developing nature\nof emerging growth countries presents political, social and economic risks to IBM's business, including 10 risks\nfrom inadequate infrastructure and labor disruptions in these countries, which could impact the company's ability to deliver to its clients around the world. Protection of Intellectual Property: While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to\nits success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a\nnumber of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and conditions. These\nprotections may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's nor can there be any assurance that these protections will\nadequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Data Protection: The company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and processes, involve the storage and\ntransmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. Breaches of the company's security measures could expose\nthe company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the loss of existing\nor potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant. Seasonality of Revenues and Purchases: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and\nservices, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower\nrevenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter,\nmay affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. Local Legal, Economic and Health Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in 170 countries\nworldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates could affect the\ncompany's business in that country and the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and\nby macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations\nbetween the U.S.\u00a0dollar and local currency. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza (bird\nflu) or any other pandemic, or local or global health issues, could adversely affect the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers and customer\ndemand. Insurance: The company maintains third party insurance coverage against various liability risks and risks of property loss.\nWhile we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against liability and property damage risks, the potential liabilities associated with those risks or other events could exceed the\ncoverage provided by such arrangements. Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning\nthe discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs,\nfines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and 11 regulations.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive position. Tax Matters: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's\nprovision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in\ncountries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax\nlaws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is\nsubject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting\nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on\nthe company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. Internal Controls: Effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reasonable assurance with respect to\nits financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If the company cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to its financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, the company's operating\nresults could be affected. Pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the company is required to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including management's\nassessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of\nhuman error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair\npresentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the\ncontrol may\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed, the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, and there could be a material adverse effect on the company's stock price. Use of Estimates: In connection with the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and the preparation\nof the Consolidated Financial Statements, the company uses certain estimates and assumptions, which are based on historical experience and management's knowledge of current events and actions that the\ncompany may undertake in the future. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion on pages\u00a047 to 49 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders.\nIn addition, as discussed in note\u00a0N, \"Contingencies and Commitments\" on pages\u00a094 through 96 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the\nprovisions of SFAS No.\u00a05, \"Accounting for Contingencies\", including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. While management believes that these estimates and assumptions are\nreasonable under the circumstances, by definition they involve the use of judgment and the exercise of discretion, and therefore, actual results may differ. Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures. The company's\nbusinesses face a significant number of competitors, ranging from some of the world's largest global enterprises to an increasing number of relatively small, rapidly growing and highly specialized\norganizations. The company believes that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and the breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors.\nIntense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for the company's products and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market opportunity. Unlike 12 many\nof its competitors, the company has a broad set of capabilities and businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of\nthese product lines. As a result, the company may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that its competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial,\ntechnical and marketing resources available to them than the businesses against which they compete. Volatility of Stock Price: The company's stock price is affected by a number of factors, including quarterly variations in\nfinancial results, the competitive landscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections by the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the\ncompany's stock price is subject to significant volatility. Dependence on Key Personnel and Reliance on Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the\ncontinued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are in high demand\nand competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers retire. In addition,\ncompanies in the information technology and services industry whose employees accept positions with IBM may claim that IBM has interfered with noncompete obligations of their former employees, engaged\nin unfair hiring practices or that the employment of these persons by IBM would involve the disclosure or use of trade secrets. Any such claims could limit or prevent IBM from hiring employees or\ncause it to incur liability for damages or substantial costs in defending the company or its employees against these claims, whether or not they have merit. Further, many of IBM's key personnel\nreceive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's\nequity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw\nmaterials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers, although the company makes every effort to\nassure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a\ntimely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability\nof the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues from its affiliates\noperating in local currency environments and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's\ncustomer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination\nof residual values, and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments.\nDerivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks\nwill be successful. Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium\nbusinesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients in the company's Financial Services, Public, and Small\nand Medium business sectors. The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the\ncompany performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' 13 financial\nconditions. The company maintains reserves that it believes are adequate to cover exposure for any uncollectible receivables and regularly reviews such reserves by considering factors such\nas write-off history, aging analysis and any specific, known troubled accounts. If the company becomes aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer,\nor, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves, which could affect the company's consolidated net\nincome in the period the adjustments are made. Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors and\nresellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from\ntime to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will\nmanage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the\nfailure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issues debt securities in the worldwide capital\nmarkets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including, the methods\nemployed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level,\ndirection and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control.\nThe company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this\nItem\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors\". There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to factors described under Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors\", including the section entitled \"Volatility of Stock Price\", as well as\neconomic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond\nthe company's control. Since the market price of IBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. 14 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2007, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 20\u00a0million square feet, of\nwhich 16\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 2\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM\nbusinesses. Similar facilities in 8\u00a0other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 2\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 1\u00a0million\nsquare feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

See note\u00a0M \"Stockholders' Equity Activity\" on\npages\u00a092 through 93 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report for additional information regarding the accelerated share repurchase agreements executed in the second quarter of 2007. The common stock\nrepurchase program does not have an expiration date. As discussed in note\u00a0M \"Stockholders' Equity Activity\" on pages\u00a092 through 93 of IBM's 2007 Annual Report, the company does not\nexpect the accelerated share repurchase agreements settlement periods to conclude until March 2008. On December\u00a03, 2007, the company announced that it plans to repurchase up to\n$1\u00a0billion of its outstanding common stock in open market transactions by the end of February 2008. This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the exercise price in connection with\ncashless exercises of employee stock options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee equity awards.

The\nweighted-average exercise price of these options was $79. The company has not made, and will not make, any future grants or awards of equity securities under the plans of these acquired companies. (2) The\nnumbers included for PSUs in column\u00a0(a) above reflect the maximum number payout. Assuming target number payout, the number of securities to be issued upon the exercise of\nPSUs for equity compensation plans approved by security holders is 1,386,629 and for equity compensation plans not approved by security holders is 1,397,194. For additional information about PSUs,\nincluding payout calculations, refer to the information under \"2007 Summary Compensation Table Narrative\" in IBM's definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange 18 Commission\nand delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April\u00a029, 2008. The\nmaterial features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 LONG \u2014 TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN The 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"2001 Plan\") is used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the company. Awards for\nsenior executives of the company will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"1999 Plan\"). Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are\nidentical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards). The\n2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company\ncertain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable\nor assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the Committee. If\nthe employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of the participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be canceled\nimmediately, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits\nunder the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may\nbe, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable Award Agreement. In addition, unless the Award Agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend,\nwithhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awards at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Award Agreement and the\nPlan. In addition,\nAwards are cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company. PWCC ACQUISITION LONG \u2014 TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN The IBM PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"PWCC Plan\") was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company's\nacquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\"PwCC\") from PricewaterhouseCoopers\u00a0LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to\nfund awards for employees of PwCC who have come over to the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and\nconditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN The IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \"DCEAP\") was adopted in 1993. Under the DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee\nShares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company's common stock. Upon a director's retirement or other completion of\nservice as a director, all amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company's stock at the director's election. (For additional information about the\nDCEAP, see 2007 Director Compensation Narrative in IBM's definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and 19 Exchange\nCommission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April\u00a029, 2008).

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of\nNew York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 80\nyears ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems\nthrough integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling\nnew capabilities that generate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing. STRATEGY In IBM's view, today's networked economy has created a global business landscape and a mandate for business change. It also opens the\nopportunity to upgrade the efficiency and effectiveness of the global infrastructure through embedded information technology\u2014what IBM calls a \"smarter planet.\" Smart airports, smart\nhighways, smart supply chains are all possible. IBM is working with clients and governments around the world to explore these opportunities and implement new ideas. Integrated\nglobal economies have opened markets of new opportunity and new sources of skills. The Internet has enabled communication and collaboration across the world and brought with\nit a new computing model premised on continuous global connection. In that landscape, companies can distribute work and technology anywhere in the world. IBM continues to adjust its footprint toward\nemerging geographies, tapping their higher growth, providing the technology infrastructure they need and taking advantage of the talent pools they provide to better service the company's clients. At\nthe same time, the current economic crisis increases the pressure on both businesses and governments around the world to adapt. The needs for additional transparency, security and\nefficiencies are clear. Given\nthese opportunities and economic challenges, IBM is working with its clients to develop new business designs and technical architectures that allow their businesses the flexibility\nrequired to compete in this new landscape. IBM's strategy addresses this new era and delivers value to its clients through three strategic priorities: Focus on Open Technologies and High-Value Solutions A new computing model has emerged, replacing the PC-based, client/server approach. This new model is networked, modular, open and\nrepresents a fundamental shift in the technology requirements of the company's clients. IBM is well positioned to provide its enterprise clients the open technologies and high-value\nsolutions they will need to compete. \u2022 IBM is leveraging its leadership position in the convergence of software and services, in service oriented architecture\n(SOA), in virtualization, business intelligence and analytics, in open and modular information technology (IT)\u2014continuing its shift from commoditizing segments to higher value segments\nwith better profit opportunity. \u2022 The company continues to be a leading force in open source solutions to enable its clients to achieve higher levels of\ninteroperability, cost efficiency and quality. 1 Deliver Integration and Innovation to Clients Changes in the market have caused IBM's clients to seek flexibility and innovation in everything from technical architecture to their\nbusiness model. In response, IBM is focused on delivering integration and innovation to its clients\u2014offering them technologies and services that support real value creation. \u2022 IBM has a long heritage of transforming the business operations of large enterprises and has earned the trust to be their\ninnovation partner and global integrator. \u2022 The company has an extensive set of global assets and capabilities it is applying to improve services profitability, both\nfor its clients and for itself. Become the Premier Globally Integrated Enterprise As global networks and technology capabilities change business economics, legacy business designs can quickly become noncompetitive.\nIBM believes a globally-integrated enterprise, designed for this new landscape, can compete effectively and will benefit from the opportunities offered. \u2022 To reshape its business for the global economy, IBM has replaced vertical hierarchies with horizontally integrated teams. \u2022 Across the business, the company has made significant investments in emerging markets, taking core processes and functions\nthat were once managed regionally and shifting them to a globally integrated model. Looking\nforward, IBM is confident it understands the economic shift of globalization, the evolution of the new computing model and the powerful role of innovation in this new landscape.\nIts unique capabilities are well adapted to help the company's clients innovate and compete effectively in this new environment. BUSINESS MODEL The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients succeed in delivering business value by becoming\nmore innovative, efficient and competitive through the use of business insight and IT solutions; and, providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over\ntime through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have the best long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, hardware, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nbusiness insight and solutions for the company's clients. The\nbusiness model is flexible, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company has divested commoditizing businesses like personal computers and hard\ndisk drives, and strengthened its position through strategic investments and acquisitions in higher value segments like business intelligence and analytics, virtualization and green solutions. In\naddition, the company has transformed itself into a globally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and participation in the world's fastest growing\nmarkets. As a result, the company is a higher performing enterprise today than it was several years ago. The\nbusiness model, supported by the company's long-term financial model, has enabled the company to deliver consistently strong earnings, cash flows and returns on invested\ncapital in changing economic environments. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES The company's major operations are comprised of: a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Software\nsegment; a Systems and Technology segment; and a Global Financing segment. 2 Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to clients. While\nsolutions often include industry-leading IBM software and hardware, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Within Global Services there are two reportable segments:\nGlobal Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) primarily provides IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering business value through the\ncompany's global scale, standardization and automation. GTS Capabilities Strategic Outsourcing Services. Comprehensive IT services integrated with business insight working with clients to reduce costs and\nimprove productivity through the outsourcing of processes and operations. Integrated Technology Services. Services offerings that help clients access, manage and support their technology infrastructures, through\na combination of skilled resources, software and IBM's knowledge of business processes. The portfolio includes Service Product Lines which complement hardware from Systems and Technology and software\nofferings from the Software business. Business Transformation Outsourcing. A range of offerings from standardized processing platforms and Business Process Outsourcing through\ntransformational offerings that deliver improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications and infrastructure. Maintenance. A number of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain and improve the availability of\nclients' IT infrastructure. Global Business Services (GBS) primarily provides professional services and application outsourcing services, delivering business value and innovation\nto clients through solutions which leverage industry-and business-process expertise. GBS Capabilities Consulting and Systems Integration. Delivery of value to clients through consulting services for client relationship management, financial\nmanagement, human-capital management, business strategy and change, and supply-chain management. Application Management Services. Application development, management, maintenance and support services for packaged software, as well as\ncustom and legacy applications. Value is delivered through the company's global resource capabilities, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application development. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and\napplications across a standard software platform. IBM middleware is designed to open standards which allows the efficient integration of disparate client applications that may have been built\ninternally, or provided by packaged software vendors or system integrators. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. Approximately two-thirds of external software\nsegment revenue is annuity-based, coming from recurring license charges and ongoing subscription and support from one-time charge (OTC) arrangements. The remaining one-third of\nexternal revenue relates to OTC arrangements, in which the client pays one up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year\nof maintenance. The client can also purchase ongoing maintenance after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. 3 Software Capabilities WebSphere Software. Management of a wide variety of business processes using open standards to interconnect applications, data and\noperating systems. Provides the foundation for Web-enabled applications and is a key product set in deploying a SOA. Information Management Software.

IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution 4 \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Integrated Supply Chain \u2022 Integrated Technology Delivery \u2022 Business Process Delivery Sales and Distribution IBM has a significant global presence, operating in over 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution of\nrevenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country based operating units focused on delivering client value. Within these units,\nclient relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients'\nbusiness performance. These teams deliver value by understanding the clients' business and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to\ndevelop and implement solutions. By\ncombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and\ntimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by\nleveraging industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources. In\n2008, the company implemented a new growth markets organization to increase its focus on the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China and the additional opportunities\naround the world that have market growth rates greater than the global average\u2014countries within Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The company's major\nmarkets include the United States, Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Cyprus, Norway,\nIsrael, Spain, the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. The\nmajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six\nsectors: \u2022 Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation \u2022 Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 Small and Medium Business: Mainly companies with less than 1,000 employees Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually spends approximately\n$6\u00a0billion for R&D, focusing its investments on high-growth, high-value opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded\nmore U.S. patents in 2008 than any other company, the first company to achieve over 4,000 patents in a year. The company will continue to actively seek intellectual property protection for its\ninnovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual property leadership and promote innovation. 5 In\naddition to producing world-class hardware and software products, IBM innovations are also a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through its services\nbusinesses. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1\u00a0billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used\nexclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's various proprietary intellectual property\nrights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or\nis licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and\nconditions. Integrated Supply Chain Consistent with the company's work with clients to transform their supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global\nmarket conditions, the company continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, which provides a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM\nleverages its supply chain expertise for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end\nsupply-chain processes, from procurement to logistics. IBM\nspends approximately $38\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. The supply, manufacturing and logistics and customer fulfillment\noperations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed costs to variable costs.\nSimplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes, and these actions have improved client satisfaction. Integrated Technology Delivery Integrated Technology Delivery (ITD) combines all of the worldwide service delivery capabilities for Strategic Outsourcing with strong\nlocal and regional management teams supported by a set of global competencies. ITD leverages the company's global scale and advanced technology to deliver standardized solutions that are automated,\nrepeatable and globally integrated. Clients gain cost advantages, access to industry-leading skills and IBM's scale and overall flexibility. ITD manages the world's largest privately-owned IT\ninfrastructure with employees in over 40 countries supporting over 450 data centers. Business Process Delivery Business Process Delivery (BPD) provides highly efficient, world-class delivery capabilities in IBM's business process delivery\noperations, which include Business Transformation Outsourcing, Business Process Outsourcing and Business Process Services. BPD has employees and delivery centers in over 40 countries worldwide. COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, doing business in over 170 countries. The company participates in the highly\ncompetitive information technology (IT) industry, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall,\nacross its business segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide.

Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for systems,\nsoftware and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and\nfunctions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources in both emerging and\nmore established geographical markets. These efforts may not yield their intended gains in overall efficiency and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's ability to meet its growth\nand productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from\ncommoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its\ncutting-edge innovation in the highly competitive IT industry, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition,\nIBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized\nfor its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in growth\nopportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, to drive revenue growth and market share gains.\nClient adoption rates and viable economic models are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities,\nit needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social and economic\nrisks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and\nto deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Breaches of Data Protection could impact the Company's Business: The company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and\nprocesses, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. Breaches in security\ncould expose the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the\nloss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be\nsignificant. 10 The Company's Revenues for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of\nnew products and services, the length of the sales cycles, the structure of products and services contracts and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are\ndifficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered\nat the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business in that country\nand the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including\nrecessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and local currency. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any\nterrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company\nregularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from\nthese continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension\nPlans: Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future\nestimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company\ncould be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders\nincludes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. 11 Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The company's most critical\naccounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0O,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments\" in IBM's 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates under the provisions of SFAS No.\u00a05, \"Accounting for Contingencies,\" including\ndecisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because by definition these estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, actual financial results may differ. Competitive Conditions: The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive pressures (see discussion about\ncompetition in Item\u00a01. Business above). The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information\ntechnology industry are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced\nworkers retire. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish\nthe company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes\nin the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to\ndeliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies\nor materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a\nsignificant percentage of its revenues from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies\nand the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations\non the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks,\nincluding the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's\nefforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide 12 variety\nof industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's\n2008 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the\nworld's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit\nbasis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if\nfuture actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its reserves for uncollectible receivables, which could affect the\ncompany's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its\nability to bring its products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions and Alliances include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant\nchallenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related\nrisks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the\nassumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled\n\"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. 13 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2008, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n19\u00a0million square feet, of which 15\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 2\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was\nbeing leased to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 8\u00a0other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 2\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was\nleased. Of these amounts, 1\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of\nNew York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological invention, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 80\nyears ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems\nthrough integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling\nnew capabilities that generate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing. STRATEGY Despite the volatility of the information technology (IT) industry over the past decade, IBM has consistently delivered superior\nperformance, with a steady track record of sustained earnings per share growth. The company has shifted its business mix, exiting commoditized segments while increasing its presence in higher-value\nareas such as services, software and integrated solutions. As part of this shift, the company has acquired over 100 companies this past decade, complementing and scaling its portfolio of products and\nofferings. IBM's\nclear strategy has enabled steady results in core business areas, while expanding its offerings and addressable markets. The key tenets of this strategy\nare: \u2022 Deliver value to enterprise clients through integrated business and IT innovation \u2022 Build/expand strong positions in growth initiatives \u2022 Shift the business mix to higher-value software and services \u2022 Become the premier globally integrated enterprise These\npriorities reflect a broad shift in client spending away from \"point products\" and toward integrated solutions, as companies seek higher levels of business value from their IT\ninvestments. IBM has been able to deliver this enhanced client value thanks to its industry expertise, understanding of clients' businesses and the breadth and depth of the company's capabilities. IBM's\ngrowth initiatives, like its strengthened capabilities, align with these client priorities. These initiatives include Smarter Planet and Industry Frameworks, Growth Markets,\nBusiness Analytics and\nCloud Computing. Each initiative represents a significant growth opportunity with attractive profit margins for IBM. Smarter Planet and Industry Frameworks Smarter planet is an overarching strategy that highlights IBM's differentiated capabilities and generates broad-based demand for the\ncompany's products and services. Smarter Planet encapsulates IBM's view of enterprise IT's next major revolution: the instrumentation and integration of the world's processes and\ninfrastructures\u2014from energy grids and pipelines to supply chains and traffic systems. The massive amount of data these systems are generating can now be captured and analyzed. This\ninfusion of intelligence enables more efficiency, productivity and responsiveness. 1 Clients\nseeking these \"smart\" solutions value IBM's deep industry and process expertise, powerful back-end systems and data analytics, complex systems integration capability\nand unique research capacity. IBM's\nIndustry Frameworks create a flexible software foundation for developing, acquiring and deploying smart industry solutions. Each framework supports multiple solutions, enabling\nfast, efficient and tailored capabilities in support of clients' business needs. These frameworks represent a proven technique for the company to engage with its clients, driving sustained growth and\nhigh business value. They cover a wide variety of industries and domains, most of which are directly tied to Smarter Planet. Growth Markets The company has benefited from its investments over the past several years in growth markets. The focus now is on geographic expansion\nof IBM's presence; on specific industry verticals of the highest impact and opportunity; on countries' build-out of infrastructure aligned with their national agendas; and on creating\nmarkets and new business models to serve the different requirements that exist in these emerging countries. In\norder to support this growth, IBM is continuing to invest significantly in these markets to expand capacity and develop talent. At the same time, IBM is expanding and benefiting from\nlarge teams of talent with global missions of delivery. The company continues to deepen its research and development (R&D) teams to design for the unique challenges and rapid growth facing these\nmarkets. Business Analytics and Optimization Business optimization through the application of advanced analytics is emerging as another major category of business value. It\nsucceeds earlier generations of back-office automation, basic enterprise resource planning and traditional business intelligence. Advanced analytics allow clients to see patterns in data\nthey could not see before, understand their exposure to risk and predict the outcomes of business decisions with greater certainty. IBM's\napproach is end-to-end, providing cross-enterprise as well as industry-based analytics solutions. IBM has established the Business Analytics and\nOptimization practice, leveraging IBM consulting capabilities and software products, along with systems and research assets. IBM's breadth of expertise uniquely positions the company for revenue and\nprofit growth. Cloud Computing \"Cloud\" is an emerging consumption and delivery model for many IT-related services. Clients are attracted to its improved\neconomics, flexibility and user experience. Traditional enterprise IT will increasingly integrate with these new cloud deployments, delivered as services via the Internet (also known as public clouds)\nor behind a firewall (private clouds). In discussions with enterprise clients, most are initially focused on private cloud implementations, the middle ground between the traditional enterprise IT and\npublic clouds. IBM\nis helping clients determine how to leverage cloud computing to achieve business advantage. The company provides a full set of capabilities, from support in designing and\nimplementing cloud solutions, to services for running and managing them if desired. IBM is applying its deep experience in critical areas such as security, reliability and innovation to deliver\ndifferentiated value. The company is also investing in new cloud initiatives tailored to particular industries, in conjunction with its partners and clients, to deliver cloud business services\ndirectly to the market. By providing deployment choice, optimizing solutions based on workload characteristics and delivering complete service management capabilities, IBM is positioned as the leading\ncloud service and infrastructure provider for enterprises. 2 BUSINESS MODEL The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients succeed in delivering business value by becoming\nmore innovative, efficient and competitive through the use of business insight and IT solutions; and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over\ntime through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have the best long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nbusiness insight and solutions for the company's clients. The\nbusiness model is flexible, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company continues to divest commoditizing businesses and strengthen its\nposition through strategic investments and acquisitions in higher value segments like business analytics, smarter planet and cloud computing. In addition, the company has transformed itself into a\nglobally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and participation in the world's fastest growing markets. As a result, the company is a higher\nperforming enterprise today than it was several years ago. The\nbusiness model, supported by the company's long-term financial model, has enabled the company to deliver consistently strong earnings, cash flows and returns to\nshareholders in changing economic environments. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES The company's major operations comprise: a Global Technology Services segment; a Global Business Services segment; a Software segment;\na Systems and Technology segment; and a Global Financing segment. Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to\nclients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and systems, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Approximately 60 percent of external Global\nServices segment revenue is annuity-based, coming primarily from outsourcing, maintenance and custom application management services arrangements. The Global Services backlog provides a solid revenue\nbase entering each year. Within Global Services, there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) primarily provides IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering business value through the\ncompany's global scale, standardization and automation. G TS CAPABILITIES Strategic Outsourcing Services. Comprehensive IT outsourcing services dedicated to transforming clients' existing infrastructures to\nensure better quality, cost control, adaptability, security and compliance. IBM integrates long-standing experience in service management, technology and industry applications with new\ntechnologies, such as cloud computing and virtualization, to enable new capabilities for clients. Business Transformation Outsourcing. A range of offerings from standardized processing platforms and Business Process Outsourcing through\ntransformational offerings that deliver improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications and infrastructure. Integrated Technology Services. Project-based portfolio of services that enable clients to optimize their IT environments by driving\nefficiency, flexibility and productivity, while reducing costs. The 3 standardized\nportfolio is built around key assets and patented software, and incorporates best practices and proven methodologies that ensure predictive quality of delivery, security and compliance. Maintenance. A complete line of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain and improve the\navailability of clients' IT infrastructure. The\nGTS outsourcing businesses are supported by integrated worldwide delivery organizations: Integrated Technology Delivery (ITD) is responsible for worldwide service delivery supporting the Strategic Outsourcing business. It\nmanages the world's largest privately-owned IT infrastructure with employees in over 40 countries, supporting over 450 data centers. ITD operates a globally integrated delivery model which supports\nregional client-facing teams by utilizing a global network of competencies and centers. Each competency provides industry-leading, standardized, integrated tools and processes. By leveraging IBM's\nglobal scale, skills and technology which is combined with the innovation from IBM research, clients gain access to leading edge, high-quality services with improved productivity, flexibility and\ncost.

In 2009, the company announced the creation of a new consulting service line dedicated to the market\nfor advanced business analytics and business optimization. Application Management Services. Application development, management, maintenance and support services for packaged software, as well as\ncustom and legacy applications. Value is delivered through the company's global resource capabilities, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application development. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems, processes and\napplications across a standard software platform. IBM middleware is designed on open standards, making it easier to integrate disparate business applications, developed by different methods and\nimplemented at different times. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. Approximately two-thirds of external software segment revenue is annuity-based, coming from\nrecurring license charges and ongoing subscription and support from one-time charge (OTC) arrangements. The remaining one-third relates to OTC arrangements in which clients pay\none, up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, arrangements for the sale of OTC software include one year of subscription and support. Clients can also purchase ongoing\nsubscription and support after the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. S OFTWARE CAPABILITIES WebSphere Software. Delivers capabilities that enable clients to integrate and manage business processes across their organizations with\nthe flexibility and agility they need to respond to changing 4 conditions\nquickly.

Semiconductor design and manufacturing primarily for use in IBM systems and storage products and for sale to external\nclients. Global Financing facilitates clients' acquisition of IBM systems, software and services. Global Financing invests in financing assets, leverages with\ndebt and manages the associated risks with the objective of 5 generating\nconsistently strong returns on equity. The primary focus on the company's offerings and clients mitigates many of the risks normally associated with a financing company. Global Financing\nhas the benefit of both a deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services that are being financed. This combination allows Global Financing to effectively manage\ntwo of the major risks (credit and residual value) that are normally associated with financing. G LOBAL FINANCING CAPABILITIES Client Financing. Lease and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms generally between two and seven years. Internal\nfinancing is predominantly in support of Global Services' long-term client service contracts. Global Financing also factors a selected portion of the company's accounts receivable,\nprimarily for cash management purposes. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial Financing. Short-term inventory and accounts receivable financing to dealers and remarketers of IT products. Remarketing. The sale and lease of used equipment to new or existing clients both externally and internally. This equipment is primarily\nsourced from the conclusion of lease transactions. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily\nrepresents used equipment that is sold or leased internally to the Systems and Technology and Global Services segments. The Systems and Technology segment may also sell the equipment that it purchases\nfrom Global Financing to external clients. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Integrated Supply Chain Sales and Distribution IBM has a significant global presence, operating in more than 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution\nof revenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country-based operating units focused on delivering client value. Within these units,\nclient relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance. These teams deliver value by\nunderstanding the clients' businesses and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop and implement solutions. By\ncombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and\ntimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by\nleveraging industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources. In\n2008, the company implemented a new growth markets organization to increase its focus on the emerging markets around the world that have market growth rates greater than the global\naverage\u2014countries within Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The company's major markets include the United States (U.S.), Canada, the United Kingdom (U.K.),\nFrance, 6 Germany,\nItaly, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Cyprus, Norway, Israel, Spain, the Bahamas and the Caribbean region. The\nmajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six\nsectors: \u2022 Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation \u2022 Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 General Business: Mainly companies with fewer than 1,000 employees Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's R&D operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests approximately $6\u00a0billion for R&D,\nfocusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. As a result of innovations in these and other areas, IBM was once again awarded more U.S. patents in 2009 than any other\ncompany, the 17th\u00a0consecutive year IBM has been the patent leader. IBM's 4,914\u00a0patents in 2009 were the most U.S. patents ever awarded to one company in a single year. Consistent with\nthe shift in the company's business mix, approximately 70\u00a0percent of these patents were for software and services. The company will continue to actively seek intellectual property protection\nfor its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual property leadership and promote innovation. In\naddition to producing world-class systems, software and technology products, IBM innovations are also a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through\nits services businesses. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1\u00a0billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are\nused exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's various proprietary intellectual\nproperty rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM\nowns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms\nand conditions. Integrated Supply Chain Consistent with the company's work with clients to transform their supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global\nmarket conditions, the company continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, thereby providing a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients.\nIBM leverages its supply-chain expertise for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end\nsupply-chain processes, from procurement to logistics. IBM\nspends approximately $35\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. The supply, manufacturing and logistics and customer fulfillment\noperations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time, improved response to\nmarketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed costs to variable costs. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and\nprocesses. 7 COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, doing business in more than 170 countries. The company participates in the highly\ncompetitive information technology (IT) industry, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall,\nacross its business segments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. The\nmarkets for each of the company's business segments is characterized by aggressive competition among all types of competitors. Across its business, the company's principal methods of\ncompetition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and services; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to\nclients; and, service and support. In order to maintain leadership in the IT industry, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. Over the past several years, the company has been\nexecuting a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through internal investments and strategic\nacquisitions. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments. A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Global Services: The services segments, GTS and GBS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. GTS competes in strategic\noutsourcing, business transformation outsourcing, integrated technology services and IT support services. GBS competes in consulting, system integration and application management services. The\nprincipal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, the ability to add value and the\ntime-to-value, price, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in the\nservices business include its global reach and scale, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise and infrastructure management, an ability to\ndeliver integrated solutions that can address clients' needs in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. The company competes with\nbroad based competitors including Accenture, Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu and Hewlett-Packard Company (HP); India-based service providers including HCL, Infosys, Tata Consulting Services and\nWipro Technologies; and, many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Software: The enterprise management software market is highly competitive and the key competitive factors in this segment include: functionality,\nease of use, scalability, compliance with open standards and total cost of ownership. The company's leadership in these areas provides it with competitive advantages. The company's software business\nincludes middleware, operating systems and related software provided to all industry segments worldwide. The middleware portfolio is the broadest in the industry and it also covers both mainframe and\ndistributed computing environments. The depth and breadth of the company's software offerings, coupled with its global sales and technical support infrastructure differentiate the company's software\nbusiness from its competitors. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute to this segment's leadership. The company's\nprincipal competitors in this segment include BMC Software, CA,\u00a0Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation. In addition, the company competes with smaller, niche competitors in specific\ngeographic or product markets worldwide. 8 Systems and Technology: The enterprise server and storage market is highly competitive and is characterized by ongoing technology innovation, with competition\nfocused on value, function and reliability, and new entrants leveraging technology to compete against traditional offerings. The company's principal competitors include Dell,\u00a0Inc. (Dell), EMC\nCorporation, HP and Sun Microsystems. The company's leadership in virtualization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its systems platforms to leverage\nthe entire system, from the company's custom semiconductors through the software stack to increase efficiency and lower cost, provide the company with competitive advantages in this segment. In\naddition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's leadership. Global Financing: The Global Financing business provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. In\n2009, the continued global financial credit crisis impacted both the client and commercial financing markets. The supply of credit remained tight and financial institutions continued to face increases\nin loan losses, higher borrowing costs and liquidity challenges. Global Financing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive advantage for the company. The\nkey competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing\ncompetes with three types of companies in providing financial services to IT customers: other captive financing companies such as Dell and HP, non-captive companies such as General\nElectric Company and banks or financial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment\nmarket.

Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for systems,\nsoftware and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and\nfunctions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources in both emerging and more established geographical markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality,\nproductivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from\ncommoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its\ncutting-edge innovation in the highly competitive IT industry, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition,\nIBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized\nfor its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in growth\nopportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, to drive revenue growth and market share gains.\nClient adoption rates and viable economic models are uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities,\nit needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature\npresents potential political, social and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the\ncompany's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Breaches of Data Security could impact the Company's Business: The company's products and services, as well as its internal systems and\nprocesses, involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others. Breaches in security\ncould expose the company, its customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the company, as well as the\nloss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be\nsignificant. 11 The Company's Revenues for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of\nnew products and services, the length of the sales cycles, the structure of products and services contracts and the seasonality of technology purchases. As a result, the company's results are\ndifficult to predict. These factors historically have resulted in lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products ordered\nat the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business in that country\nand the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including\nrecessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and local currency. In addition,\nany widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability\nto source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The\ncompany regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes\nfrom these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension\nPlans: Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future\nestimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company\ncould be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of\noperations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the U.S. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of\ninsolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of\nplan assets, 12 which\ncould negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions\nregarding pension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The company's most critical\naccounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0O,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. Because by definition\nthese estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are\nin high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company.\nIn addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a total\ncompensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity awards,\nputting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes\nin the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to\ndeliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies\nor materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a\nsignificant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S.\ncurrencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness,\ninterest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number\nof strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be\nno assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. 13 The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If the\ncompany becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its reserves for uncollectible receivables, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its\nability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be\nunable to fund and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions and Alliances include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and alliances present significant\nchallenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related\nrisks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the\nassumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different\ncurrencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the\naggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls,\ngovernmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is\ndependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will\nbe able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. 14 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2009, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n19\u00a0million square feet, of which 16\u00a0million was owned and 3\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 3\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was\nbeing leased to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 8\u00a0other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 2\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was\nleased. Of these amounts, 1\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of\nNew York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over\n85 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems\nthrough integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling\nnew capabilities that generate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing. STRATEGY Despite the volatility of the information technology (IT) industry over the past decade, IBM has consistently delivered superior\nperformance, with a steady track record of sustained earnings per share growth. The company has shifted its business mix, exiting commoditized segments while increasing its presence in higher-value\nareas such as services, software and integrated solutions. As part of this shift, the company has acquired over 100 companies this past decade, complementing and scaling its portfolio of products and\nofferings. IBM's\nclear strategy has enabled steady results in core business areas, while expanding its offerings and addressable markets. The key tenets of this strategy\nare: \u2022 Deliver value to enterprise clients through integrated business and IT innovation; \u2022 Shift the business mix to higher-value areas; and \u2022 Become the premier globally integrated enterprise These\npriorities reflect a broad shift in client spending away from \"point products\" and toward integrated solutions, as companies seek higher levels of business value from their IT\ninvestments. IBM has been able to deliver this enhanced client value thanks to its industry expertise, understanding of clients' businesses and the breadth and depth of the company's capabilities. Consistent\nwith this strategy IBM is leveraging its capabilities to build and expand strong positions in targeted growth areas. IBM's growth initiatives include Smarter Planet, Growth\nMarkets, Business Analytics and Optimization, and Cloud Computing. Each initiative represents a significant growth opportunity with attractive profit margins for IBM. Smarter Planet Smarter Planet is an overarching strategy that highlights IBM's differentiated capabilities and generates broad-based demand for the\ncompany's products and services. Smarter Planet encapsulates IBM's view of enterprise IT's next major revolution: the instrumentation and integration of the world's processes and\ninfrastructures\u2014from energy grids and pipelines to supply chains and traffic systems. The amount of data these systems can generate can now be captured and analyzed. This infusion of\nintelligence enables more efficiency, productivity and responsiveness. Clients\nseeking these \"smart\" solutions value IBM's deep industry and process expertise, powerful back-end systems and data analytics, complex systems integration capability\nand unique research capacity. IBM has built a series of horizontal solutions through organic development and strategic acquisitions including smarter commerce and smarter physical infrastructure.\nIBM's Industry Frameworks provide a flexible software foundation for developing, acquiring and deploying these smart industry solutions. Each framework supports multiple solutions, enabling fast,\nefficient and tailored 1 capabilities\nin support of clients' business needs. These frameworks represent a proven technique for the company to engage with its clients, driving sustained growth and high business value in\nsupport of our Smarter Planet strategy. Growth Markets The company has benefited from its investments over the past several years in growth markets. The focus now is on geographic expansion\nof IBM's presence; on specific industry verticals of the highest impact and opportunity; on countries' build-out of infrastructure aligned with their national agendas; and on creating\nmarkets and new business models to serve the different requirements that exist in these emerging countries. In\norder to support this growth, IBM is continuing to invest significantly in these markets to expand capacity and develop talent. At the same time, IBM is expanding and benefiting from\nlarge teams of talent with global missions of delivery. The company continues to deepen its research and development (R&D) teams to design for the unique challenges and rapid growth facing these\nmarkets. Business Analytics and Optimization Business optimization through the application of analytics across the business has emerged as another major category of business value.\nIt succeeds earlier generations of back-office automation, basic enterprise resource planning and traditional business intelligence. Business analytics allows clients to see patterns in\ndata they could not see before, understand their exposure to risk, and predict the outcomes of business decisions with greater certainty. IBM's\napproach is end-to-end, providing cross-enterprise as well as industry-based analytics solutions. IBM has established the Business Analytics and\nOptimization practice, leveraging IBM consulting capabilities and software products, along with systems and research assets. IBM's breadth of expertise uniquely positions the company for revenue and\nprofit growth. Cloud Computing Cloud is a new model for consuming and delivering IT and business services. It can deliver significant economies of scale, higher\nqualities of service and a new platform for business model innovation. The power of the model comes from harnessing vast stores of under-utilized technology with highly efficient virtualization and\nmanagement, consumer-style user interfaces and the ubiquitous broadband. IBM\nhas helped thousands of clients adopt aspects of cloud computing. IBM is helping them build their own cloud-based infrastructures, provide security and integration services or\noffering infrastructure and business services from the IBM Cloud, including advanced analytics, collaboration, and IT infrastructure including virtual servers and storage or access to tools for\ntesting software. IBM brings expert consulting, breakthrough technologies, and a portfolio of cloud services squarely focused on the requirements of the enterprise. IBM has also implemented the cloud\nmodel within IBM in areas as diverse as sales analytics and research collaboration. BUSINESS MODEL The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients succeed in delivering business value by becoming\nmore innovative, efficient and competitive through the use of business insight and IT solutions; and providing\nlong-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have the best long-term\ngrowth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nbusiness insight and solutions for the company's clients. 2 The\nbusiness model is resilient, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company continues to divest commoditizing businesses and strengthen its\nposition through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value segments like business analytics, smarter planet and cloud computing. In addition, the company has transformed itself\ninto a globally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and expanding participation in the world's fastest growing markets. As a result, the company is\na higher performing enterprise today than it was several years ago. This\nbusiness model, supported by the company's long-term financial model, has enabled the company to deliver consistently strong earnings, cash flows and returns to\nshareholders in changing economic environments. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES The company's major operations consists of five business segments: Global Technology Services, Global Business Services, Software,\nSystems and Technology and Global Financing. Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to\nclients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and systems, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Approximately 60\u00a0percent of external\nGlobal Services segment revenue is annuity-based, coming primarily from outsourcing, maintenance and custom application management services arrangements. The Global Services backlog provides a solid\nrevenue base entering each year. Within Global Services, there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) primarily provides IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering business value\nthrough the company's global scale, standardization and automation. GTS\nCapabilities Strategic Outsourcing Services. Comprehensive IT outsourcing services dedicated to transforming clients'\nexisting infrastructures to ensure better quality, flexibility, risk management and financial value. IBM integrates long-standing experience in service management, technology and industry\napplications with new technologies, such as cloud computing and virtualization, to help clients maximize the application of technology to achieve their business objectives. Global Process Services. A range of offerings from standardized processing platforms and business process outsourcing through\ntransformational offerings that deliver improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications and infrastructure\n(previously known as Business Transformation Outsourcing). Integrated Technology Services. Project-based portfolio of services that enable clients to optimize their IT environments by driving\nefficiency, flexibility and productivity, while reducing costs. The standardized portfolio is built around key assets and patented software, and incorporates best practices and proven methodologies\nthat ensure predictive quality of delivery, security and compliance. Maintenance. A complete line of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain and improve the\navailability of clients' IT infrastructures. GTS Services Delivery. Responsible for the worldwide delivery of IBM's technology- and process-based services. In support of\ntechnology-based services, GTS Services Delivery manages the world's largest privately owned IT infrastructure with employees in over 40 countries, supporting approximately 430 data centers. Operating\nin a globally integrated delivery model enables regional client-facing teams to utilize a global network of competencies and centers. Each competency provides industry-leading, standardized,\nintegrated tools and processes. By leveraging insights and experience drawn from IBM's global scale, skills and technology, with applied innovation from IBM Research, clients gain access to\nleading-edge, high-quality services with improved productivity, flexibility and cost. 3 GTS\nServices Delivery also provides efficient, world-class delivery capabilities in support of IBM's process-based services, which include Business Transformation Outsourcing, Business\nProcess Outsourcing and Business Process Services. These delivery capabilities are available to clients through highly skilled employees and delivery centers in over 40 countries worldwide. Global Business Services (GBS) primarily provides professional services and application management services, delivering business value and\ninnovation to clients through solutions which leverage industry and business-process expertise while integrating the industry-leading portfolio of IBM and strategic partners, to define the upper end\nof client-valued services. GBS\nCapabilities Consulting and Systems Integration. Delivery of value to clients through consulting services for Strategy and\nTransformation; Application Innovation Services; Enterprise Applications (SAP and Oracle) and Business Analytics and Optimization. Application Management Services. Application development, management, maintenance and support services for packaged software, as well as\ncustom and legacy applications. Value is delivered through advanced capabilities in areas such as applications testing and modernization, cloud application security, the company's highly\ndifferentiated globally integrated capability model, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application development. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,\nprocesses and applications across a standard software platform. IBM middleware is designed on open standards, making it easier to integrate disparate business applications, developed by different\nmethods and implemented at different times. Operating systems are the software engines that run computers. Approximately two-thirds of external software segment revenue is annuity-based,\ncoming from recurring license charges and ongoing subscription and support. The remaining one-third relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements in which clients pay one,\nup-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, the sale of OTC software includes one year of subscription and support. Clients can also purchase ongoing subscription and support\nafter the first year, which includes product upgrades and technical support. Software\nCapabilities WebSphere Software. Delivers capabilities that enable clients to integrate and manage business processes across\ntheir organizations with the flexibility and agility they need to respond to changing conditions quickly. With a services-oriented architecture (SOA), businesses can more easily link together their\nfragmented data and business processes to extract value from their existing technology. Information Management Software. Enables clients to integrate, manage and use their information to gain business value and improve their\noutcomes. Solutions include advanced database management, enterprise content management, information integration, data warehousing, business analytics and intelligence, performance management and\npredictive analytics.

Jazz, Rational's technology platform, transforms 4 the\nway people work together to build software, making software delivery more collaborative, productive and transparent. Business Analytics. Enables clients to better analyze their data and predict outcomes in order to make better business decisions.\nSolutions include Cognos' business intelligence software, which provides comprehensive tools that range from querying to forecasting; as well as SPSS predictive analytics software that helps clients\npredict outcomes and act on that insight. Operating Systems. Software that manages the fundamental processes that make computers run. Systems and Technology provides clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities. Approximately\nhalf of Systems and Technology's server and storage sales transactions are through the company's business partners; with the balance direct to end-user clients. In addition, Systems and\nTechnology provides leading semiconductor technology, products and packaging solutions to clients and for IBM's own advanced technology needs. Systems\nand Technology Capabilities Systems. A range of general purpose and integrated systems designed and optimized for specific business, public\nand scientific computing needs. These systems\u2014System z, Power Systems and System\u00a0x\u2014are typically the core technology in data centers that provide required infrastructure\nfor business and institutions. Also, these systems form the foundation for IBM's integrated offerings, such as IBM Smart Business Storage Cloud, IBM Smart Analytics Cloud, IBM Smart Analytics System\nand IBM CloudBurst. IBM servers use both IBM and non-IBM microprocessor technology and operating systems. All IBM servers run Linux, a key open- source operating system. Storage. IBM provides data storage products and solutions that allow clients to retain and manage rapidly growing, complex volumes of\ndigital information. These solutions address critical client requirements for information retention and archiving, data deduplication, availability and virtualization, and security and compliance. The\nportfolio consists of a broad range of disk and tape storage systems and software, including the ultra-scalable disk storage system XIV. Retail Store Solutions. Point-of-sale retail systems (network connected cash registers) as well as solutions which\nconnect them to other store systems. Microelectronics. Semiconductor design and manufacturing primarily for use in IBM systems and storage products as well as delivering\nsemiconductors and related services to external clients. Global Financing facilitates clients' acquisition of IBM systems, software and services. Global Financing invests in financing assets,\nleverages with debt and manages the associated risks with the objective of generating consistently strong returns on equity. The primary focus on the company's offerings and clients mitigates many of\nthe risks normally associated with a financing company. Global Financing has the benefit of both a deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services that are being\nfinanced. This combination allows Global Financing to effectively manage two of the major risks (credit and residual value) that are normally associated with financing. Global\nFinancing Capabilities Client Financing. Lease and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms generally between two\nand seven years. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Global Services' long-term client service contracts. Global Financing also factors a selected portion of the company's\naccounts receivable, primarily for cash management purposes. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial Financing. Short-term inventory and accounts receivable financing to dealers and remarketers of IT products. Remanufacturing and Remarketing. As equipment is returned at the conclusion of a lease transaction, these assets are refurbished and sold\nor leased to new or existing clients both externally and internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and 5 resellers.\nInternally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold or leased internally to the Systems and Technology and Global Services segments. The Systems and\nTechnology segment may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Enterprise Transformation \u2022 Integrated Supply Chain Sales and Distribution IBM has a significant global presence, operating in more than 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution\nof revenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country-based operating units focused on delivering client value. Within these units,\nclient relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance. These teams deliver value by\nunderstanding the clients' businesses and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop and implement solutions. By\ncombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and\ntimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by\nleveraging industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources. Through\nits growth markets organization, the company continues to increase its focus on the emerging markets around the world that have market growth rates greater than the global\naverage\u2014countries within Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The company's major markets include the United States (U.S.), Canada, the United Kingdom (U.K.),\nFrance, Germany, Italy, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Cyprus, Norway, Israel, Spain, the Bahamas and the\nCaribbean region. The\nmajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six\nsectors: \u2022 Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation \u2022 Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 General Business: Mainly companies with fewer than 1,000 employees Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's R&D operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests approximately $6\u00a0billion for R&D,\nfocusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. The company has rebalanced its internal R&D. Today, IBM's portfolio is built around networked, modularized and embedded\ntechnologies, as well as business intelligence and analytics. In 2010, the company was once 6 again\nawarded more U.S. patents than any other company, the 18th\u00a0consecutive year IBM has been the patent leader. IBM's 5,896 patents in 2010 were the most U.S. patents ever awarded to one\ncompany in\na single year. Over 70\u00a0percent of the patents issued in 2010 were for software and services. The company's R&D efforts continue to push the frontiers of science and technology\u2014from\nanalytics, to cloud, to a computer named Watson that applied advanced analytics to defeat the all-time champions on the television quiz show, Jeopardy. In\naddition to producing world-class systems, software and technology products, IBM innovations are also a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through\nits services businesses. As an example, the company's Research unit has the world's largest mathematics department of any public company. This unit is actively involved with most of the company's\nbusiness analytics client engagements. The\ncompany will continue to actively seek intellectual property protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual\nproperty leadership. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1\u00a0billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used\nexclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's various proprietary intellectual property\nrights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or\nis licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and\nconditions. Enterprise Transformation A key element of the company's strategy has been focused on becoming the premier globally integrated enterprise. In the early part of\nthe decade, the company drove implementation of a consistent set of processes and standards worldwide to reduce inefficiencies and improve collaboration. With its processes fully integrated, the\ncompany implemented a new operating model with work shared in global resource centers of excellence located where it made the most business sense. Since 2005, global integration has enabled the\ncompany to reduce spending by over $5\u00a0billion and improve service quality, speed and risk management. The company has shifted resources toward building client relationships and employees\nskills, while positioning the company for new market opportunities. During this period, IBM has pioneered this new operating model, changing from a classic \"multinational\", with smaller versions of\nthe parent company replicated in countries around the world, to a global model with one set of processes, shared services and broadly distributed decision making. The\ncompany is now embarking on the next generation of its transformation in which new capabilities and technologies like business analytics and cloud computing will drive performance.\nThe proven principles of the globally integrated enterprise will be applied to all of the company's spending to continue to drive additional productivity benefits in shared services, integrated\noperations and end-to-end process transformation. Integrated Supply Chain Consistent with the company's work with clients to transform their supply chains for greater efficiency and responsiveness to global\nmarket conditions, the company continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain, thereby providing a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients.\nIBM leverages its supply-chain expertise for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end\nsupply-chain processes, from procurement to logistics. 7 IBM spends approximately $35\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. The supply, manufacturing and logistics and customer fulfillment\noperations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time, improved response to marketplace opportunities and external risks and converted fixed costs to variable costs.\nSimplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved operations, sales force productivity and processes. COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, doing business in more than 170 countries. The company participates in a highly\ncompetitive environment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business\nsegments, the company recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. The\nmarkets for each of the company's business segments is characterized by aggressive competition among all types of competitors. Across its business, the company's principal methods of\ncompetition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and services; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to\nclients; and, service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. Over the past decade, the company has been executing a strategy to\ntransform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic investments and strategic acquisitions. As the company executes\nits strategy, it enters new markets, such as smarter planet and business analytics, which exposes the company to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its\nbusiness segments. A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Global Services: The services segments, GTS and GBS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. GTS competes in strategic\noutsourcing, business process outsourcing, cloud services, and a wide range of technical and IT support services. GBS competes in consulting, system integration and application management services.\nThe principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry knowledge and experience, value and speed,\nprice, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in the services business include its global\nreach and scale, global delivery model, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise, services assets, an ability to deliver integrated solutions\nthat can address clients' needs in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. The company competes with broad based competitors\nincluding: Accenture, Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu and Hewlett-Packard Company (HP); India-based service providers including HCL, Infosys, Tata Consulting Services, Cognizant and Wipro\nTechnologies; the consulting practices of public accounting firms including Deloitte Consulting; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Software: The enterprise management software market is highly competitive, and the key competitive factors in this segment include:\nfunctionality, ease of use, scalability, compliance with open standards and total cost of ownership. The company's leadership in these areas provides it with competitive advantages. The company's\nsoftware business includes middleware, operating systems and related software provided to all industry segments worldwide. The middleware portfolio is the broadest in the industry and it also covers\nboth mainframe and distributed computing environments. The depth and breadth of the company's software offerings, coupled with its global sales and technical support infrastructure differentiate the\ncompany's software business from its competitors. In addition, the company's research 8 and\ndevelopment capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute to this segment's leadership. The company's principal competitors in this segment include CA,\u00a0Inc., Microsoft\nCorporation and Oracle Corporation (Oracle). In addition, the company competes with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets worldwide. Systems and Technology: The enterprise server and storage market is highly competitive and is characterized by ongoing technology innovation, with competition\nfocused on value, function and reliability, and new entrants leveraging technology to compete against traditional offerings. The company's principal competitors include Dell,\u00a0Inc. (Dell), EMC\nCorporation, HP and Oracle. The company's leadership in virtualization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its systems platforms to leverage the entire\nsystem, from the company's custom semiconductors through the software stack to increase efficiency and lower cost, provide the company with competitive advantages in this segment. In addition, the\ncompany's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's leadership. Global Financing: The Global Financing business provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. In\n2008 and 2009, the economic crisis drove an increase in credit spreads which stabilized in 2010. However, going forward the supply of credit may tighten and financial institutions may continue to face\nincreases in loan losses, higher borrowing costs and liquidity challenges. Global Financing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive advantage for the\ncompany. The key competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global\nFinancing competes with three types of companies in providing financial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of companies such as HP and Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc.,\nnon-captive financing entities of companies such as General Electric Company and banks or financial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus\noriginal manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

All\nexecutive officers are elected by the Board of Directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the\nBy-laws. Each executive officer named above has been an executive of IBM or its subsidiaries during the past five years. 10 Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for systems,\nsoftware and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and\nfunctions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality,\nproductivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from\ncommoditized categories of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its\ncutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive environment, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition,\nIBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized\nfor its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in growth\nopportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models\nare uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix\nof trained, skilled and experienced\npersonnel. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business\npartners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Breaches of Data Security could impact the Company's Business: The company's products, services, and systems may affect critical third\nparty operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees, customers and others.\nBreaches in security could expose the company, its customers or others to risks of loss, including the misuse of information or systems, resulting in litigation and potential liability for the\ncompany, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data\nprotection measures could be significant. 11 The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products\nand services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic\nreview by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had\nlower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the\nfourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside\nthe United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the\ncompany's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including\nrecessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global\nhealth issue, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The\ncompany regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes\nfrom these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension\nPlans: Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future\nestimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company\ncould be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of\noperations and 12 financial\nresults could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the U.S. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of\nunrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets,\nwhich could negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions\nregarding pension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most\ncritical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0O,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and\nassumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are\nin high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company.\nIn addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a\ntotal compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity\nawards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes\nin the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to\ndeliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies\nor materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval.\nAlso, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In 13 addition,\nthe company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of\noperations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a\nsignificant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S.\ncurrencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency\nfluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage\nthese risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the\ncompany's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its\nability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be\nunable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions and Alliances include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions or enter into alliances. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks\nrelating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company\nfailing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities\nrelated to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. 14 entitled\n\"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2010, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n19\u00a0million square feet, of which 16\u00a0million was owned and 3\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 3\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was\nbeing leased to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 7\u00a0other countries totaled 5\u00a0million square feet, of which 2\u00a0million was owned and 3\u00a0million was\nleased. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of\nNew York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over\n85 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems\nthrough integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling\nnew capabilities that generate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing. STRATEGY Despite the volatility of the information technology (IT) industry over the past decade, IBM has consistently delivered excellent\nperformance, with a steady track record of sustained earnings per share growth. The company has shifted its business mix, exiting certain segments while increasing its presence in higher-value areas\nsuch as services, software and integrated solutions. As part of this shift, the company has acquired over 120 companies since 2000, complementing and scaling its portfolio of products and offerings. IBM's\nclear strategy has enabled steady results in core business areas, while expanding its offerings and addressable markets. The key tenets of this strategy\nare: \u2022 Deliver value to enterprise clients through integrated business and IT innovation; \u2022 Shift the business mix to higher-value areas; and \u2022 Become the premier globally integrated enterprise These\npriorities reflect a broad shift in client spending toward integrated solutions, as companies seek higher levels of business value from their IT investments. IBM has been able to\ndeliver this enhanced client value thanks to its industry expertise, understanding of clients' businesses and the breadth and depth of the company's capabilities. Consistent\nwith this strategy IBM is leveraging its capabilities to build and expand strong positions in targeted growth areas. IBM's growth initiatives include Smarter Planet, Growth\nMarkets, Business Analytics and Optimization and Cloud Computing. Each initiative represents a significant growth opportunity with attractive profit margins for IBM. Smarter Planet Smarter Planet is IBM's vision of a technology-enabled world that is more instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent than ever\nbefore, enabling people and organizations to tackle significant business and societal challenges. At the heart of this vision is the opportunity for meaningful innovation\u2014exploring and\nextending the boundaries of businesses, industries and communities. It's about helping the company's clients become better at what they do for their clients. IBM's strategy is to accelerate progress\ntowards a \"smarter planet\" by equipping its clients with the advanced, integrated capabilities that they will need to thrive in this exciting new world that is unfolding before\nus\u2014capabilities such as business analytics, business process management, social business and cloud computing. Over\nthe past year, IBM has steadily deepened its commitment to understanding and delivering on the promise of a smarter planet for its line of business and IT clients across a broad\nrange of industries. An industry-based approach is central to the strategy, since every industry confronts a 1 distinct\nset of challenges and opportunities in today's constantly transforming world. Whether \"smarter\" means helping a hospital group to deliver improved healthcare, a local government to ease\ntraffic congestion, or a retail chain to execute a successful cross-channel campaign, IBM is aggressively developing and investing in a portfolio of industry solutions that will help these clients\nachieve their goals. Two\nrecently announced initiatives that are already driving significant value illustrate IBM's deep commitment to building a smarter planet: Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities. IBM's\nSmarter Commerce model integrates and transforms how companies manage and adapt their buy, market, sell and service processes, placing the customer squarely at the center of their business. IBM's\nSmarter Cities initiative enables local governments to make smarter decisions, anticipate issues and coordinate resources more effectively, and deliver citizen-centric services that underpin\nsustainable economic growth. Growth Markets The company has benefited from its investments over the past several years in growth markets. The focus now is on geographic expansion\nof IBM's presence; on selected industries of the highest impact and opportunity; on countries' build-out of infrastructure aligned with their national agendas; and on creating markets and\nnew business models to\nserve the different requirements that exist in these emerging countries. The company's efforts in developing new growth markets within the African continent is a good example of this focus. Many of\nthese initiatives are leading edge, both in technologies and business models and are delivering both increased revenue and margin expansion. In\norder to support this growth, IBM is continuing to invest significantly in these markets to expand capacity, to develop talent and to deepen its research and development (R&D)\ncapabilities on the ground. At the same time, IBM continues to leverage talent across growth markets under its globally integrated enterprise model to the benefit of both its clients and the company\nglobally. Business Analytics and Optimization Business Analytics and Optimization is core to achieving a Smarter Planet, helping leaders of this new information-centric and\ninsight-driven world make better and faster business decisions. As the proliferation of \"big data\" continues from both structured and unstructured sources, IBM is helping organizations leverage\nanalytics in new ways to address market uncertainty, complexity and volatility. These capabilities allow decision makers to identify patterns and gain deeper insights in a way that is unimaginable by\nother means. These insights give organizations the ability to anticipate and shape better outcomes so they can grow, retain and satisfy customers. They can now dynamically plan, forecast and align\nresources and manage risk, reduce fraud and ensure compliance. They can also leverage analytics to increase operational efficiency and agility. IBM's\napproach is to ensure customers have complete end-to-end solutions across industries and functional focus areas like sales, finance and risk. These\nsolutions are designed to help organizations: develop an information and analytics strategy that flows from the business strategy; establish a strong information foundation; make analytics skills and\ncapabilities pervasive; and create a culture that takes action on analytics. IBM continues to invest in its analytics capabilities to deliver real world solutions that its clients can put to work\ntoday. These ongoing investments in both organic development and new acquisitions are complemented by IBM's focus on game-changing innovations like Watson, which is ushering in a new\ngeneration of probabilistic analytics that can dramatically improve decision making through natural language processing, hypotheses generation and evidence-based learning. It is another unique example\nof just how far organizations can go with IBM analytics. Cloud Computing Cloud is a new model for consuming and delivering business and IT services. It can deliver significant economies of scale, enable\nhigher qualities of service and even serve as a transformative 2 platform\nfor business innovation. From a business perspective, the promise of cloud computing lies in the ability to shape influential communities, launch product innovations and explore new business\nmodels with minimal time, cost and effort. From an IT perspective, the power of the model comes from harnessing vast stores of underutilized technology with highly efficient virtualization and\nmanagement, consumer-style user interfaces and ubiquitous broadband. IBM\nhas already helped thousands of its clients adopt and leverage cloud computing through its broad portfolio of IBM SmartCloud products, solutions and services. Today, IBM delivers\nmany line-of-business solutions via cloud-based hosting models, enabling rapid adoption and exploration of new capabilities that can drive significant business value for its\nclients and their customers. For developers and IT organizations seeking to leverage cloud computing, IBM can help build out private, on-premise cloud-based environments, provide security\nand integration services across private and hybrid cloud models, and/or offer its own cloud-based infrastructure and services, including advanced analytics, collaboration, and IT infrastructure such\nas virtual servers, storage and tools for testing software. Across IBM's entire SmartCloud portfolio, the company offers expert consulting, breakthrough technologies and a portfolio of cloud-based\nservices squarely focused on the requirements of the enterprise. BUSINESS MODEL The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients to become more innovative, efficient and\ncompetitive through the application of business insight and IT solutions; and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic\ninvestments in capabilities and technologies that have superior long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nintegrated solutions to the company's clients. The\nbusiness model is resilient, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company continues to divest certain businesses and strengthen its position\nthrough strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value segments like business analytics, smarter planet and cloud computing. In addition, the company has transformed itself into a\nglobally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and expanding participation in the world's fastest growing markets. This\nbusiness model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES The company's major operations consists of five business segments: Global Technology Services, Global Business Services, Software,\nSystems and Technology and Global Financing. Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to\nclients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and systems, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Approximately 60 percent of external Global\nServices segment revenue is annuity based, coming primarily from outsourcing and maintenance arrangements. The Global Services backlog provides a solid revenue base entering each year. Within Global\nServices, there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) primarily provides IT infrastructure services and business process services, delivering business value\nthrough global scale, standardization and automation. 3 GTS\nCapabilities Strategic Outsourcing Services: comprehensive IT outsourcing services dedicated to transforming clients' existing infrastructures to consistently\ndeliver improved quality, flexibility, risk management and financial value. The company integrates long-standing expertise in service management and technology with the ability to exploit\nthe power of new technologies from IBM systems and software, such as cloud computing, analytics and virtualization, to deliver high performance, innovation and improved ability to achieve business\nobjectives. Global Process Services: a range of standardized through transformational offerings including processing platforms and business process outsourcing.\nThese services deliver improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications and infrastructure. Integrated Technology Services: project-based portfolio of services that enable clients to optimize their IT environments by driving efficiency,\nflexibility and productivity, while reducing costs. The standardized portfolio is built around key assets and patented software, and incorporates best practices and proven methodologies that ensure\npredictive quality of delivery, security and compliance. Maintenance: a complete line of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain and improve the availability of\nclients' IT infrastructures. GTS Services Delivery: responsible for the worldwide delivery of IBM's technology- and process-based services. Operating within a globally integrated\ndelivery model enables regional client-facing teams to utilize a global network of competencies and centers, providing industry-leading, standardized, integrated tools and processes. By leveraging\ninsights and experience drawn from IBM's global scale, skills and technology, with applied innovation from IBM Research, clients gain access to leading-edge, high-quality\nservices with improved productivity, flexibility, cost and outcomes. Global Business Services (GBS) primarily provides professional services and application management services, delivering business value and\ninnovation to clients through solutions which leverage industry and business-process expertise while integrating the industry-leading portfolio of IBM and strategic partners, to define the upper end\nof client-valued services. GBS\nCapabilities Consulting and Systems Integration: delivery of value to clients through consulting services for Strategy and Transformation; Application Innovation\nServices; Enterprise Applications and Business Analytics and Optimization. Application Management Services: application development, management, maintenance and support services for packaged software, as well as custom and\nlegacy applications. Value is delivered through advanced capabilities in areas such as applications testing and modernization, cloud application security, the company's highly differentiated globally\nintegrated capability model, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application development. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,\nprocesses and applications across a standard software platform to improve their business results, solve critical problems and gain competitive advantage within their industries. IBM middleware is\ndesigned on open standards, making it easier to integrate disparate business applications, developed by different methods and implemented at different times. Operating systems are the software engines\nthat run computers. Approximately two-thirds of external software segment revenue is annuity based, coming from recurring license charges and ongoing subscription and support. The\nremaining one-third relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements in which clients pay one, up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, the sale of OTC\nsoftware includes one year of subscription and support. Clients can also purchase ongoing subscription and support after the first year, which includes unspecified product upgrades and technical\nsupport. 4 Software\nCapabilities WebSphere Software: delivers capabilities that enable clients to integrate and manage business processes across their organizations with the\nflexibility and agility they need to respond to changing conditions quickly. With a services-oriented architecture (SOA), businesses can more easily link together their fragmented data and business\nprocesses to extract value from their existing technology. Smarter Commerce software enables seamless interaction between companies, their customers and suppliers throughout the business cycle,\nresulting in better customer experience, higher sales, lower inventories, better service levels and improved response times.

The primary focus on the company's offerings and clients mitigates many of\nthe risks normally associated with a financing company. Global Financing has the benefit of both a deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services that are being\nfinanced. This combination allows Global Financing to effectively manage two of the major risks (credit and residual value) that are normally associated with financing. Global\nFinancing Capabilities Client Financing: lease and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms generally between one and seven years. Internal financing is\npredominantly in support of Global Services' long-term client service contracts. Global Financing also factors a selected portion of the company's accounts receivable, primarily for cash\nmanagement purposes. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial Financing: short-term inventory and accounts receivable financing to dealers and remarketers of IT products. Remanufacturing and Remarketing: as equipment is returned at the conclusion of a lease transaction, these assets are refurbished and sold or leased\nto new or existing clients both externally and internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment revenue\nprimarily represents used equipment that is sold or leased internally to Systems and Technology and Global Services. Systems and Technology may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global\nFinancing to external clients. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Enterprise Transformation \u2022 Integrated Supply Chain Sales and Distribution IBM has a significant global presence, operating in more than 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution\nof revenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country-based operating units focused on delivering client value. Within these units,\nclient relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve clients' business performance. These teams deliver value by\nunderstanding the clients' businesses and\nneeds, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop and implement solutions. 6 By\ncombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and\ntimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by\nleveraging industry skills with marketing, ibm.com and local Business Partner resources. Through\nits growth markets organization, the company continues to increase its focus on the emerging markets around the world that have market growth rates greater than the global\naverage\u2014countries within Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The company's major markets include the G7 countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,\nthe United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.) plus Austria, the Bahamas, Belgium, the Caribbean region, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Malta, the Netherlands,\nNorway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The\nmajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six\nsectors: \u2022 Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation \u2022 Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 General Business: Mainly companies with fewer than 1,000 employees Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's R&D operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests approximately $6\u00a0billion for R&D,\nfocusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM\nResearch works with clients and IBM business units on near-term and mid-term innovations and solutions and, in many cases, qualifies new technologies to be\ntransferred to IBM development organizations. It also explores the boundaries of science and technology\u2014from nanotechnology, to systems, to analytics, to cloud, to IBM Watson, a computer\nsystem that applied advanced analytics to defeat the all-time champions on the television quiz show, Jeopardy! In\naddition to producing world-class systems, software and technology products, IBM innovations also are a major differentiator in providing solutions for the company's clients through\nits services businesses. IBM Research has the world's largest mathematics department of any public company. This unit is actively involved with many of the company's business analytics client\nengagements. In\n2011, the company once again was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company, the 19th consecutive year IBM has been the patent leader. IBM's 6,180 patents in 2011 were the most\nU.S. patents ever awarded to one company in a single year; more than 70\u00a0percent of the patents IBM was issued in 2011 were for software and services. The\ncompany continues to actively seek intellectual property protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual property\nleadership. The company's investments in R&D also result in intellectual property (IP) income of approximately $1 billion annually. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in\nIBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are\nimportant to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed\nunder a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Licenses under many of the patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to others under reasonable terms and\nconditions. 7 Enterprise Transformation A key element of the company's strategy has been focused on becoming the premier globally integrated enterprise. The company has\nimplemented a consistent set of processes and standards worldwide to reduce inefficiencies and improve collaboration. With its processes fully integrated, the company implemented a new operating model\nwith work shared in global resource centers of excellence located where it made the most business sense. Since 2005, global integration has enabled the company to deliver over $6\u00a0billion in\nproductivity and improve service quality, speed and risk management. The company has shifted resources toward building client relationships and employees skills, while positioning the company for new\nmarket opportunities. During this transformation, IBM pioneered this new operating model, changing from a classic \"multinational,\" with smaller versions of the parent company replicated in countries\naround the world, to a global model with one set of processes, shared services and broadly distributed decision making. The\ncompany has now embarked on the next generation of its transformation in which new capabilities and technologies like business analytics and cloud computing will drive performance.\nThe proven principles of the globally integrated enterprise will be applied to all of the company's spending to continue to drive additional productivity benefits in shared services, integrated\noperations and end-to-end process transformation. Integrated Supply Chain IBM spends approximately $35\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. In addition,\nin 2011, the company managed approximately\n$20\u00a0billion in procurement spending for its clients through the Global Process Services organization. The supply, manufacturing and logistics and customer fulfillment operations are integrated\nin one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved sales force productivity and operational effectiveness and efficiency.\nContinuous improvements to supply chain resiliency against market-place changes and risks have been particularly valuable in maintaining continuity during natural disasters and other disruptive events\nthat are occurring with increased frequency. The\ncompany's continuing efforts to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain provides a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM\nleverages its supply-chain expertise for clients through its supply-chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end\nsupply-chain processes, from procurement to logistics. COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 170 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive\nenvironment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the\ncompany recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. Across\nits business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and\nservices; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and, service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and\nintegrate. The company has been executing a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic\ninvestments and strategic acquisitions. As the company executes its strategy, it enters new markets, such as smarter planet and business analytics, which exposes the company to new competitors.\nOverall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments. 8 A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Global Services: The services segments, GTS and GBS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. GTS competes in strategic\noutsourcing, business process outsourcing, cloud services, and a wide range of technical and IT support services. GBS competes in consulting, system integration and application management services.\nThe principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry knowledge and experience, value and speed,\nprice, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in the services business include its global\nreach and scale, global delivery model, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise, services assets, an ability to deliver integrated solutions\nthat can address clients' needs in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. The company competes with broad based competitors\nincluding: Accenture, Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu and Hewlett-Packard Company (HP); India-based service providers; the consulting practices of public accounting firms; and many companies\nthat primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Software: The enterprise management software market is highly competitive, and the key competitive factors in this segment include:\nfunctionality, ease of use, scalability, compliance with open standards and total cost of ownership. The company's leadership in these areas provides it with competitive advantages. The company's\nsoftware business includes middleware, operating systems and related software that provide comprehensive solutions to all industry segments worldwide. The middleware portfolio is the broadest in the\nindustry and it also covers both mainframe and distributed computing environments. The depth and breadth of the company's software offerings, coupled with its global sales and technical support\ninfrastructure differentiate the company's software business from its competitors. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio\ncontribute to this segment's leadership. The company's principal competitors in this segment include CA,\u00a0Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation (Oracle). In addition, the company\ncompetes with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets worldwide. Systems and Technology: The enterprise server and storage market is highly competitive and is characterized by ongoing technology innovation, with competition\nfocused on value, function and reliability, and new entrants leveraging technology to compete against traditional offerings. The company's principal competitors include Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco),\nDell,\u00a0Inc. (Dell), EMC Corporation, HP and Oracle. The company's leadership in virtualization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its systems\nplatforms to leverage the entire system, from the company's custom semiconductors through the software stack to increase efficiency and lower cost, provide the company with competitive advantages in\nthis segment. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's leadership. Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. The economic\ncrisis of 2008 and 2009 drove an increase in credit spreads and a tightening supply of credit which have subsequently eased. However, going forward credit spreads may increase and the supply of credit\nmay tighten based on worldwide economic conditions. Global Financing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive 9 advantage\nfor the company. The key competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In\nclient and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in providing financial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of companies such as Cisco\nand HP and non-captive financing entities of companies such as General Electric Company and banks or financial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local and regional\nbrokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

All\nexecutive officers are elected by the Board of Directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the\nBy-laws. Each executive officer named above has been an executive of IBM or its subsidiaries during the past five years. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for systems,\nsoftware and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and\nfunctions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality,\nproductivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from certain\nsegments of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself 11 through\ninnovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive environment, the company could fail in its\nongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition, IBM\nhas one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for\nits industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in growth\nopportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing and dozens of emerging countries to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models\nare uncertain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix\nof trained, skilled and experienced personnel. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure,\ncreditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the\nworld. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business: The company's products, services, and systems may affect\ncritical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees,\ncustomers and others. Breaches of security could expose the company, its customers or others to risks of loss, including the misuse of information or systems, resulting in litigation and potential\nliability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing\nfurther data protection measures could be significant. Also, the company could be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products\nand services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic\nreview by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had\nlower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the\nend of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. 12 Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's\noverall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions,\ninflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S.\nand globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, or any terrorist\nactivities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The\ncompany regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes\nfrom these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension\nPlans: Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future\nestimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company\ncould be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of\noperations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the U.S. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of\ninsolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of\nplan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain\nassumptions regarding pension matters. 13 Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most\ncritical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0M,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and\nassumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are\nin high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced\nworkers leave the company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. Further, many of IBM's\nkey personnel receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of\nthe company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes\nin the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to\ndeliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies\nor materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval.\nAlso, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended\nor debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a\nsignificant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates 14 operating\nin local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's\ncustomer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination\nof residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments;\nderivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks\nwill be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2011 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its\nability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be\nunable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions and Alliances include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of Liabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make\nacquisitions or enter into alliances. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the\nintegration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to\nachieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to\nlitigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled\n\"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. 15 The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2011, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n18\u00a0million square feet, of which 16\u00a0million was owned and 2\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 2\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was\nbeing leased to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 12 other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 1\u00a0million was owned and 5\u00a0million was leased. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

The\nmaterial features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN The 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"2001 Plan\") has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior\nexecutives of the company. Awards for senior executives of the company 20 have\nbeen and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"1999 Plan\"); the 1999 Plan is also used to fund awards for employees other than\nsenior executives. Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit\nawards and long-term performance incentive awards). The\n2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company\ncertain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable\nor assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the Committee. If\nthe employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be canceled\nimmediately, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits\nunder the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may\nbe, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable Award Agreement. In addition, unless the Award Agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend,\nwithhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awards at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Award Agreement and the\nPlan. In addition, Awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the Company. PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN The IBM PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"PWCC Plan\") was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection\nwith the company's\nacquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\"PwCC\") from PricewaterhouseCoopers\u00a0LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to\nfund awards for employees of PwCC who have come over to the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and\nconditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN The IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \"DCEAP\") was adopted in 1993. Under the DCEAP, non-management\ndirectors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company's common stock. Upon a director's\nretirement or other completion of service as a director, all amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company's stock at the director's election.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of\nNew York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over\n85 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems\nthrough integrated solutions that leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling\nnew capabilities that generate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing. STRATEGY Despite the volatility of the information technology (IT) industry over the past decade, IBM has consistently delivered strong\nperformance, with a steady track record of sustained earnings per share growth and cash generation. The company has shifted its business mix, exiting certain segments while increasing its presence in\nhigher-value areas such as services, software and integrated solutions. As part of this shift, the company has acquired more than 140 companies since 2000, complementing and scaling its portfolio of\nproducts and offerings. IBM's\nstrategy of delivering high value solutions to enterprise clients has yielded consistent business results. Working with enterprise clients across the full spectrum of their\nbusiness and technical opportunities, IBM delivers leadership innovation in technology, high value solutions and insights that improve client and industry outcomes. A highly engaged, global workforce\nwith deep technical and business skills, teamed with an unmatched ecosystem of partners provides a world-class client experience. These\npriorities reflect a broad shift in client spending toward innovation and efficiency, as companies seek higher levels of business value from their IT investments. IBM has been able\nto deliver this enhanced client value thanks to its industry expertise, understanding of clients' businesses, sustained investment in core and applied research and development (R&D), global reach and\nthe breadth and depth of the company's capabilities. New\ntypes of solutions, new market opportunities and new decision makers are emerging as clients look to make use of technology to generate innovation and competitive advantage. These\nopportunities are driven by a new era of computing that is enabled by analytics, cloud computing, Big Data, mobility, social computing and supported by enterprise grade security solutions. The\ncompany's strategy is to establish leadership in this new era of smarter computing\u2014computing that is designed for Big Data, built on software-defined environments and open\u2014in\norder to enhance the value we deliver, create new markets and engage new clients. To\ncapture the opportunities arising from these market trends, IBM is focused on four key growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, Growth Markets, Business Analytics and Optimization and\nCloud Computing. Each initiative represents a significant growth opportunity with attractive profit margins for IBM. Smarter Planet Smarter Planet is IBM's vision of a technology-enabled world that is more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent than ever\nbefore, enabling people and organizations to tackle significant 1 business\nand societal challenges. At the heart of this vision is the opportunity for meaningful innovation\u2014exploring and extending the boundaries of businesses, industries and communities.\nIt's about helping the company's clients become better at what they do for their clients. IBM's strategy is to accelerate progress toward a \"smarter planet\" by equipping clients with the advanced,\nintegrated capabilities they need to thrive in this exciting new world that is unfolding before us\u2014capabilities such as analytics for business and physical systems, business process\nmanagement, social business, mobile computing and cloud computing. IBM\nhas continued to deepen its commitment to understanding and delivering on the promise of Smarter Planet for both line of business and IT executives across a broad range of\nindustries. An industry-based approach is central to the strategy, since every industry confronts a distinct set of challenges and opportunities in today's constantly transforming world. Whether\n\"smarter\" means helping a hospital group to deliver improved healthcare, a local government to ease traffic congestion, or a retail chain to execute a successful cross-channel campaign, IBM is\naggressively developing and investing in a portfolio of industry solutions that helps these clients achieve their goals. Three\ninitiatives that drive significant value illustrate IBM's deep commitment to building a smarter planet: Smarter Commerce, Smarter Cities and Social Business. IBM's Smarter Commerce\nmodel integrates and transforms how companies manage and adapt their buy, market, sell and service processes, placing the customer squarely at the center of their business. IBM's Smarter Cities\ninitiative enables federal, state and local governments to make smarter decisions, anticipate issues and coordinate resources more effectively, while delivering citizen-centric services that underpin\nsustainable economic growth. IBM's Social Business initiative helps clients integrate social technologies and practices into their front-end processes to more effectively create and share\nknowledge to accelerate innovation, improve customer service, and build a smarter workforce. Each of these initiatives is powered by market-leading IBM innovations and software, developed both by IBM\nand through acquisitions. Growth Markets The company has benefited from its investments over the past several years in the growth markets. The focus now is on geographic\nexpansion of IBM's presence; on selected industries of the highest impact and opportunity; on countries' build-outs of infrastructure aligned with their national agendas; and, on creating\nmarkets and new business models to serve the different requirements that exist in these emerging countries. The company's effort in developing new growth markets within the African continent is a good\nexample of this focus. Many of these initiatives are leading-edge, both in technologies and business models, and are delivering both increased revenue and margin expansion. In\norder to support this growth, IBM continues to invest significantly in these markets to expand capacity, to develop talent and to deepen its R&D capabilities on the ground. At the\nsame time, IBM continues to leverage talent across the growth markets under its globally integrated enterprise model to the benefit of both its clients and the company worldwide. Business Analytics and Optimization Business Analytics and Optimization (BAO) is the category of software, systems and services that help organizations take advantage of\nall the data available to them for better and faster decision making and process optimization. This includes data that is being labeled \"Big Data,\" which is data of extreme volume, data being\ngenerated at a high velocity, and newer varieties of data like blogs, tweets, pictures, videos, unstructured text created by the explosion of social media websites and the instrumentation of nearly\neverything. BAO is core to achieving a smarter planet, helping leaders of this new information-centric and insight-driven world infuse intelligence into their business processes. 2 Smarter\nAnalytics is IBM's unique offering for the BAO category. With Smarter Analytics and the company's deep expertise, IBM can help organizations: 1)\u00a0grow, retain and satisfy\ncustomers through deep insight on individual customers and similar segments; 2)\u00a0increase operational efficiency through, for example, supply chain optimization, predictive maintenance, fraud\nreduction and optimization of sales incentives and compensation; 3)\u00a0transform their financial processes such as planning, budgeting,\nforecasting, financial consolidation, regulatory filing and financial reporting; and 4)\u00a0better manage risk and regulatory compliance. The\ncompany's approach to analytics is to ensure clients have complete end-to-end solutions across industries and functional focus areas like finance, sales,\nmarketing, operations and risk. These solutions are designed to help organizations: 1)\u00a0align around all their data\u2014both traditional and big data\u2014and establish a strong\ninformation foundation; 2)\u00a0apply analytics to their data so they can anticipate and shape business outcomes, identify patterns and gain insights into future performance; 3)\u00a0enable\nworkers on the front lines who collectively make thousands and even millions of decisions daily with insight that is immediately actionable so they can make the best possible\ndecision\u2014decisions like what claims to fast track in an insurance call center, or what offer is the best for each individual customer who calls a call center; and 4)\u00a0create a\nculture that takes action on analytics and that truly transforms. IBM\nis committed to continually innovating across the spectrum of analytic capabilities, systems, research, services, deployment and skills. For example, in 2012, the game changing\ninnovations in Watson were applied to Healthcare and Financial Services, analytic research like the ground-breaking work being done on temporal causal modeling and visualization, and investments in\nanalytic skills and deployment ability in our new Analytics research centers in Columbus, Ohio and Halifax, Nova Scotia. Cloud Computing Cloud is a model for consuming and delivering business and IT services. It can deliver significant economies, enable new levels of\nspeed, flexibility and agility and even serve as a transformative platform for business innovation. From a business perspective, cloud computing is reshaping industry ecosystems, invigorating product\ninnovation and enabling new business models that leverage new sources of competitive differentiation. From an IT perspective, cloud offers improved access to and utilization of information technology\nthrough use of highly efficient virtualization and management technology, consumer-style user interfaces and ubiquitous connectivity, including via mobile technologies. IBM\nhas already helped thousands of its clients adopt and leverage cloud computing through its broad portfolio of IBM SmartCloud products, solutions and services. Organizations moving\nbeyond initial exploration of cloud computing seek solutions that align with their specific needs. IBM's breadth of cloud capabilities gives it a unique ability to help clients exploit the advantages\nof cloud. IBM has cloud solutions that span infrastructure, platform, applications and business process services all geared to enable clients to drive significant business value through the rapid\nadoption and exploitation of new cloud capabilities. IBM's expert consulting, breakthrough technologies and a portfolio of cloud-based services are squarely focused on the requirements of the\nenterprise. The\ncompany offers a full array of cloud delivery models, including private clouds, public clouds and a hybrid of both. IBM helps build out private, on-premises cloud-based\nenvironments that provide the control, security and isolation that clients require for their most mission-critical workloads. IBM public clouds provide infrastructure, platforms and applications as\nrapidly provisioned and highly-scalable cloud services on a pay-as-you-go basis. Hybrid clouds provide seamless integration across private and public cloud models,\nensuring the interoperability, portability and scalability that clients need to realize the full value of cloud. 3 BUSINESS MODEL The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping clients to become more innovative, efficient and\ncompetitive through the application of business insight and IT solutions; and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic\ninvestments in capabilities and technologies that have superior long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nintegrated solutions to the company's clients. The\nbusiness model is resilient, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company continues to divest certain businesses and strengthen its position\nthrough strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher- value segments like business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud computing. In addition, the company has transformed itself into a\nglobally integrated enterprise which has improved overall productivity and is driving investment and expanding participation in the world's fastest growing markets. This\nbusiness model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES The company's major operations consists of five business segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, which the\ncompany collectively calls Global Services, and Software, Systems and Technology and Global Financing. Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to\nclients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and systems, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Approximately 60\u00a0percent of external\nGlobal Services segment revenue is annuity based, coming primarily from outsourcing and maintenance arrangements. The Global Services backlog provides a solid revenue base entering each year. Within\nGlobal Services, there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) primarily provides IT infrastructure and business process services, creating business value for clients\nthrough unique technology and IP, integrated services within its global delivery model. By leveraging insights and experience drawn from IBM's global scale, skills and technology, with applied\ninnovation from IBM Research, clients gain access to leading-edge, high-quality services with improved productivity, flexibility, cost and outcomes. GTS\nCapabilities Strategic Outsourcing Services: delivers comprehensive IT outsourcing services dedicated to transforming\nclients' existing infrastructures to consistently deliver improved quality, flexibility, risk management and financial value. The company integrates longstanding expertise in service management and\ntechnology with the ability to exploit the power of new technologies from IBM systems and software, such as cloud computing, analytics and virtualization, to deliver high performance, innovation and\nimproved ability to achieve business objectives. Global Process Services: delivers a range of offerings consisting of standardized through transformational solutions including processing\nplatforms and business process outsourcing. These services deliver improved business results to clients through the strategic change and/or operation of the client's business processes, applications\nand infrastructure. 4 Integrated Technology Services: delivers a portfolio of project- based and managed services that enable clients to transform and optimize\ntheir IT environments by driving efficiency, flexibility and productivity, while reducing costs. The standardized portfolio is built around key assets and patented software, and incorporates best\npractices and proven methodologies that ensure predictive quality of delivery, security and compliance. Technology Support Services: delivers a complete line of support services from product maintenance through solution support to maintain\nand improve the availability of clients' IT infrastructures. Global Business Services (GBS) has the mission to deliver predictable business outcomes to the company's clients across two primary\nbusiness areas: Consulting and Application Management Services. These professional services deliver business value and innovation to clients through solutions which leverage industry and business\nprocess expertise. The role of GBS is to drive initiatives that integrate IBM content and solutions and drive the progress of the company's four primary growth initiatives. As\nclients transform themselves in response to market trends like Big Data, social and mobile computing, GBS is aligning its expertise and capabilities to address two interdependent\ncategories of opportunity: Front Office Digitization, which describes the markets forming around new models of engagement with all audiences; and the Globally Integrated Enterprise, which describes\nthe mandate to integrate data and processes in support of the new front-office programs, and build far more flexible information applications. GBS\nCapabilities Consulting: delivering client value with solutions in Strategy and Transformation, Application Innovation\nServices, Enterprise Applications and Smarter Analytics. Consulting is also focused on bringing to market client solutions that drive Front Office Digitization in Smarter Commerce, Cloud, Mobile and\nSocial Business. Application Management Services: application management, maintenance and support services for packaged software, as well as custom and\nlegacy applications. Value is delivered through advanced capabilities in areas such as application testing and modernization, cloud application services, the\ncompany's highly differentiated globally integrated capability model, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application management. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,\nprocesses and applications across a standard software platform to improve their business results, solve critical problems and gain competitive advantage within their industries. IBM middleware is\ndesigned on open standards, making it easier to integrate disparate business applications, developed by different methods and implemented at different times. Operating systems are the software engines\nthat run computers. Approximately two-thirds of external Software segment revenue is annuity based, coming from recurring license charges and ongoing post-contract support. The\nremaining one-third relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements in which clients pay one, up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, the sale of OTC\nsoftware includes one year of post-contract support. Clients can also purchase ongoing post-contract support after the first year, which includes unspecified product upgrades\nand technical support. Software\nCapabilities WebSphere Software: delivers capabilities that enable organizations to run high-performance business applications. With these\napplications, clients can integrate and manage business processes across their organizations with the flexibility and agility they need to respond to changing conditions. Built on services-oriented\narchitecture (SOA), and open standards support for cloud, mobile and social interactions, the WebSphere platform enables enterprises to extend their reach and optimize interactions with their key\nconstituents. Smarter Commerce software helps companies better manage 5 and\nimprove each step of their value chain and capitalize on opportunities for profitable growth, efficiency and increased customer loyalty. Information Management Software: enables clients to integrate, manage and analyze enormous amounts of data from a large variety of sources\nin order to gain competitive advantage and improve their business outcomes. With this approach, clients can extract real value out of their data and use it to make better business decisions. IBM's\nmiddleware and integrated solutions include advanced database\nmanagement, information integration, data governance, enterprise content management, data warehousing, business analytics and intelligence, predictive analytics and big data analytics. Tivoli Software: helps clients optimize the value they get from their infrastructures and technology assets through greater visibility,\ncontrol and automation across their end-to-end business operations. These asset management solutions foster integrated service delivery for cloud and datacenter management,\nenterprise endpoint and mobile device management, asset and facilities management, and storage management. Tivoli includes security systems software that provides clients with a single security\nintelligence platform that enables them to better secure all aspects of their enterprise and prevent security breaches. Lotus Software: enables businesses to connect people and processes for more effective communication and increased productivity through\ncollaboration, messaging and social networking software. By remaining at the forefront of collaboration tools, IBM's social business offerings help organizations reap real benefits associated with\nsocial networking, as well as create a more efficient and effective workforce. Rational Software: supports software development for both IT, as well as complex and embedded system solutions, with a suite of\nCollaborative Lifecycle Management products. Jazz, Rational's technology platform, transforms the way people work together to build software, making software delivery more integrated and\ncollaborative, while optimizing for successful business outcomes. Operating Systems: software that manages the fundamental processes that make computers run. Systems and Technology (STG) provides clients with business solutions requiring advanced computing power and storage capabilities.\nApproximately half of Systems and Technology's server and storage sales transactions are through the company's business partners; with the balance direct to end-user clients. In addition,\nSystems and Technology provides leading semiconductor technology, products and packaging solutions for IBM's own advanced technology needs and for external clients. Systems\nand Technology Capabilities Systems: a range of general purpose and integrated systems designed and optimized for specific business, public and scientific computing\nneeds. These systems\u2014System z, Power Systems and System x\u2014are typically the core technology in data centers that provide required\ninfrastructure for business and institutions. Also, these systems form the foundation for IBM's integrated offerings, such as IBM PureSystems, IBM Smart Analytics, IBM Netezza, IBM SmartCloud Entry\nand IBM BladeCenter for Cloud. IBM servers use both IBM and non-IBM microprocessor technology and operating systems. All IBM servers run Linux, a key open-source operating\nsystem. Storage: data storage products and solutions that allow clients to retain and manage rapidly growing, complex volumes of digital\ninformation. These solutions address critical client requirements for information retention and archiving, security, compliance and storage optimization including data deduplication, availability and\nvirtualization. The portfolio consists of a broad range of disk and tape storage systems and software. Microelectronics: semiconductor design and manufacturing primarily for use in IBM systems and storage products as well as delivering\nsemiconductors and related services to external clients. 6 Global Financing facilitates clients' acquisition of IBM systems, software and services. Global Financing invests in financing assets,\nleverages with debt and manages the associated risks with the objective of generating consistently strong returns on equity. The primary focus on the company's offerings and clients mitigates many of\nthe risks normally associated with a financing company. Global Financing has the benefit of both a deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services that are being\nfinanced. This combination allows Global Financing to effectively manage two of the major risks (credit and residual value) that are normally associated with financing. Global\nFinancing Capabilities Client Financing: lease and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms generally between one\nand seven years. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Global Services' long-term client service contracts. Global Financing also factors a selected portion of the company's\naccounts receivable, primarily for cash management purposes. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial Financing: short-term inventory and accounts receivable financing to dealers and remarketers of IT products. Remanufacturing and Remarketing: as equipment is returned at the conclusion of a lease transaction, these assets are refurbished and sold\nor leased to new or existing clients both externally and internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment\nrevenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Systems and Technology and Global Services. Systems and Technology may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global\nFinancing to external clients. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its\nclients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Enterprise Transformation \u2022 Integrated Supply Chain Sales and Distribution IBM has a significant global presence, operating in more than 170 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution\nof revenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages a strong global footprint, with dedicated country-based operating units focused on delivering client value. Within these units,\nclient relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to improve\nclients' business performance. These teams deliver value by understanding the clients' businesses and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business\nPartners to develop and implement solutions. By\ncombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and\ntimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by\nleveraging industry skills with marketing, Inside Sales and local Business Partner resources. Through\nits growth markets organization, the company continues to increase its focus on the emerging markets around the world that have market growth rates greater than the global 7 average\u2014countries\nwithin Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The company's major markets include the G7 countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,\nthe United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (UK) plus Austria, the Bahamas, Belgium, the Caribbean region, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Malta, the Netherlands,\nNorway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. The\nmajority of IBM's revenue, excluding the company's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) technology business, occurs in industries that are broadly grouped into six\nsectors: \u2022 Financial Services: Banking, Financial Markets, Insurance \u2022 Public: Education, Government, Healthcare, Life Sciences \u2022 Industrial: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive, Chemical and Petroleum, Electronics \u2022 Distribution: Consumer Products, Retail, Travel and Transportation \u2022 Communications: Telecommunications, Media and Entertainment, Energy and Utilities \u2022 General Business: Cross-sector representation of intermediate- sized large enterprises as well as midmarket clients (less\nthan 1,000 employees) Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's R&D operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests over $6\u00a0billion for R&D, focusing on\nhigh- growth, high-value opportunities. IBM\nResearch works with clients and the company's business units through 12 global labs on near-term and mid-term innovations. It contributes many new\ntechnologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research also explores the boundaries of science and technology\u2014from\nnanotechnology, to future systems, to big data analytics, to secure clouds, to IBM Watson, a \"cognitive\" learning system that applied advanced analytics to defeat the all-time champions on\nthe television quiz show, Jeopardy! . The Watson system has been introduced to the market for advanced healthcare applications and is being further\ndeveloped and extended within healthcare and in other industries. IBM\nResearch also focuses on differentiating IBM's services businesses providing new capabilities and solutions. It has the world's largest mathematics department of any public company,\nenabling IBM to create unique analytic solutions and actively engage with clients on their toughest challenges. In\n2012, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company for the 20th\u00a0consecutive year. IBM's 6,478 patents in 2012 included inventions that will enable fundamental\nadvancements in analytics, big data, cybersecurity, cloud, mobile, social networking and software defined environments,\nas well as industry solutions for retail, banking, healthcare, and transportation. It was the most U.S. patents ever awarded to one company in a single year. The\ncompany continues to actively seek intellectual property protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual property\nleadership. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in either/both IBM products and/or the products of the licensee.\nWhile the company's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license,\nor any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. 8 Enterprise Transformation A key element of the company's strategy has been focused on becoming the premier globally integrated enterprise. The company has\nimplemented a consistent set of processes and standards worldwide to reduce inefficiencies and improve collaboration. With its processes fully standardized, the company implemented a new operating\nmodel with work shared in global resource centers of excellence located where it made the most business sense. The company has shifted resources toward building client relationships and employee\nskills, while positioning the company for new market opportunities. During this transformation, IBM pioneered this new operating model, changing from a classic \"multinational,\" with smaller versions\nof the parent company replicated in countries around the world, to a global model with one set of processes, shared services and broadly distributed decision making. The\ncompany has now embarked on the next generation of its transformation in which new capabilities and technologies like business analytics and cloud computing will drive performance.\nThe proven principles of the globally integrated enterprise will be applied to all of the company's spending to continue to drive additional productivity benefits in shared services,\nend-to-end process transformation and integrated operations. The company primarily reinvests the benefits of its enterprise transformation initiatives in remixing its spending\nprofile and resources to the higher growth, higher margin initiatives such as business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud computing, in addition to improving profitability. Integrated Supply Chain IBM spends approximately $35\u00a0billion annually through its supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. In addition,\nin 2012, the company managed approximately $20\u00a0billion in procurement spending for its clients through the Global Process Services organization. The supply, manufacturing, and logistics and\ncustomer fulfillment operations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved sales force productivity and\noperational effectiveness and efficiency. Continuous improvements to supply chain resiliency against marketplace changes and risks have been particularly valuable in maintaining continuity during\nnatural disasters and other disruptive events. The\ncompany's continuing efforts to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain provides a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM\nleverages its supply chain expertise for clients through its supply chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply\nchain processes, from procurement to logistics. Increasingly\nthe company is using analytics to measure, manage and fine tune its supply chain operations, which will help to reshape its operations and create value for clients. The goal\nis to continue to increase the use of analytics in the five major areas of supply chain: 1)\u00a0Supply Chain Visibility, 2)\u00a0Risk Management, 3)\u00a0Customer Insight, 4)\u00a0Cost\nContainment, and 5)\u00a0Global Supply Chain\u00a0and Sustainability. COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 170 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive\nenvironment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the\ncompany recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. Across\nits business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and\nservices; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and, service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and\nintegrate. The company has 9 been\nexecuting a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic investments and strategic\nacquisitions. As the company executes its strategy, it enters new markets, such as smarter planet and business analytics, which exposes the company to new competitors. Overall, the company is the\nleader or among the leaders in each of its business segments. A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Global Services: The services segments, GTS and GBS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. GTS competes in strategic\noutsourcing, business process outsourcing, cloud services, and a wide range of technical and IT support services. GBS competes in consulting, system integration and application management services.\nThe principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry knowledge and experience, value and speed,\nprice, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in the services business include its global\nreach and scale, global delivery model, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise, services assets, an ability to deliver integrated solutions\nthat can address clients' needs in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. The company competes with broad based competitors\nincluding: Accenture, Amazon.com, Inc., Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu and Hewlett-Packard Company (HP); India-based service providers; the consulting practices of public accounting firms; and\nmany companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Software: The enterprise management software market is highly competitive and, increasingly, technology companies are looking to implement\nsoftware solutions that will improve business outcomes for their clients. The key competitive factors in this segment include: functionality, ease-of-use, scalability, open\nstandards, total cost-of-ownership and business value. IBM's leadership in each of these areas, and the ability to deliver solutions that drive business results, provides it\nwith competitive advantages. The company's software business includes middleware, solutions offerings and operating\nsystems. The middleware portfolio is the broadest in the industry and covers both mainframe and distributed computing environments. The middleware portfolio also underpins IBM's solutions business and\nenhances the business value the company brings to clients. The solutions portfolio provides comprehensive business and industry- specific offerings to new types of IT decision makers, such as chief\nmarketing and procurement officers, chief information security officers, and chief financial officers. The depth and breadth of the company's software offerings, coupled with its global sales and\ntechnical support infrastructure, differentiate the software business from its competitors. The company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio also\ncontribute to this segment's leadership. The company's principal competitors in this segment include CA,\u00a0Inc., Microsoft Corporation and Oracle Corporation (Oracle). The company also competes\nwith smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets worldwide. Systems and Technology: The enterprise server and storage market is highly competitive and is characterized by ongoing technology innovation, with competition\nfocused on value, function and reliability, and new entrants leveraging technology to compete against traditional offerings. The company's principal competitors include Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco),\nDell,\u00a0Inc., EMC Corporation, HP and Oracle. The company's leadership in virtualization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its systems platforms\nto leverage the entire system, from the company's custom 10 semiconductors\nthrough the software stack to increase efficiency and lower cost, provide the company with competitive advantages in this segment. In addition, the company's research and development\ncapabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's leadership. Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. The economic\ncrisis of 2008 and 2009 drove an increase in credit spreads and a tightening supply of credit which have subsequently eased. However, going forward credit spreads may increase and the supply of credit\nmay tighten based on worldwide economic conditions. Global Financing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures\nprovide a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and\nresidual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in providing financial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of\ncompanies such as Cisco and HP and non-captive financing entities of companies such as General Electric Company and banks or financial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes\nwith local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

Each executive officer named above has been an executive of IBM or its subsidiaries during the past five years. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Corporate IT Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for systems,\nsoftware and services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in corporate buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and\nfunctions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in quality,\nproductivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from certain\nsegments of the IT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge\ninnovation in a highly competitive environment, the company could fail in its ongoing 12 efforts\nto maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively\nimpacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative\nperceptions, our ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in growth\nopportunities, including higher-value segments of enterprise computing, cloud computing, and new and emerging markets and countries to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption\nrates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand for our other products or services.\nIn addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. In emerging growth\ncountries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption\nand corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business: The company's products, services, and systems may affect\ncritical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of employees,\ncustomers and others. Breaches of security could expose the company, its customers or others to risks of loss, including the misuse of information or systems, resulting in litigation and potential\nliability for the company, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers and damage to the company's brand and reputation. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing\nfurther data protection measures could be significant. Also, the company could be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles\nand the seasonality of technology purchases. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for\nexample, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result\nof the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth\nquarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders\nbefore the end of the quarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 170 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or 13 inadequate\nenforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic\nand political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies. Further,\nas the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. In addition, any widespread\noutbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its\nability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting\nprinciples or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous\nexamination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these\nexaminations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the\ncompany's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension\nPlans: Adverse equity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future\nestimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company\ncould be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of\noperations and financial results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the U.S. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of\ninsolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of\nplan assets, which could negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain\nassumptions regarding pension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, 14 or\nif the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most\ncritical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0M,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2012 Annual Report to\nStockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual\nfinancial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Experienced personnel in the information technology industry are\nin high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave the company.\nIn addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a\ntotal compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity\nawards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes\nin the financial or business condition of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to\ndeliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies\nor materials, or inadequate services, received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval.\nAlso, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended\nor debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a\nsignificant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S.\ncurrencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency\nfluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage\nthese risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments; derivatives involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the\ncompany's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. 15 The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and affect its\nability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be\nunable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions and Alliances include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of Liabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make\nacquisitions or enter into alliances. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the\nintegration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully. The related risks include the company failing to\nachieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to\nlitigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired business. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A.\nentitled \"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not 16 make\na market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2012, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n18\u00a0million square feet, of which 16\u00a0million was owned and 2\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 3\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was\nbeing leased to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 14 other countries totaled\n6\u00a0million square feet, of which 2\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 1\u00a0million square feet was vacant. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

The\nmaterial features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN The 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"2001 Plan\") has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior\nexecutives of the company. Awards for senior executives of the company 21 have\nbeen and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"1999 Plan\"); the 1999 Plan is also used to fund awards for employees other than\nsenior executives. Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit\nawards and long-term performance incentive awards). The\n2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors, and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company\ncertain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable\nor assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the Committee. If\nthe employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid Awards shall be canceled\nimmediately, unless the Award Agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits\nunder the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may\nbe, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable Award Agreement. In addition, unless the Award Agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend,\nwithhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred Awards at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Award Agreement and the\nPlan. In addition, Awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the Company. PWCC ACQUISITION LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN The IBM PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"PWCC Plan\") was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection\nwith the company's acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\"PwCC\") from PricewaterhouseCoopers\u00a0LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to\nbe used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have come over to the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan.\nThe terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. IBM DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND EQUITY AWARD PLAN The IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \"DCEAP\") was adopted in 1993. Under the DCEAP, non-management\ndirectors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company's common stock. Upon a director's\nretirement or other completion of service as a director, all amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company's stock at the director's election. (For\nadditional information about the DCEAP, see \"General Information\u20142012 Director Compensation Narrative\" in IBM's definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April\u00a030, 2013).

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time,\nIBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 85 years ago, in 1924, when\nC-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates business value for clients and solves business problems through integrated solutions\nthat leverage information technology and deep knowledge of business processes. IBM solutions typically create value by reducing a client's operational costs or by enabling new capabilities that\ngenerate revenue. These solutions draw from an industry leading portfolio of consulting, delivery and implementation services, enterprise software, systems and financing. STRATEGY IBM's strategy is one of innovation, transformation and a constant evolution to higher value. The company delivers innovative\nsolutions, software and infrastructure to improve client outcomes. The company helps enterprises apply technology to capture new value across their entire organizations, and it provides a\ndifferentiated client experience through a highly engaged and skilled global workforce and a broad ecosystem of partners. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to deliver on IBM's purpose of making\nour company essential to clients, employees, partners, investors and communities. Three\nstrategic imperatives shape our approach as we continuously transform IBM and align the company for higher value. 1. Make Markets by Transforming Industries and Professions with Data The emergence of big data as the world's new natural resource is the phenomenon of our time. It is being fueled by the proliferation of\nmobile devices, the rise of social media and the infusion of technology into all things and processes. Today, enterprises must harness data to create competitive advantage. The value for enterprises\nincreases as they apply more sophisticated analytics across more disparate data sources. Their real-time use of data will increasingly become a competitive differentiator. Enterprises will also need\ncognitive computing capabilities as data continues to grow in all dimensions. Therefore, IBM's strategy is to make markets by transforming industries and professions with data. The company has\ninvested more than $22 billion, including $15 billion on more than 30 acquisitions, to build its capabilities in big data and analytics. One third of IBM's research is focused on data, analytics and\ncognitive computing. The company is investing $1\u00a0billion in Watson solutions to build out the next era of cognitive systems and services. In 2013, the company realized $15.7\u00a0billion in\nbusiness analytics revenue. The original target for this business was to achieve $16\u00a0billion in revenue in 2015\u2014as a result of this performance the company has taken its 2015\nobjective for business analytics revenue to $20\u00a0billion. 2. Remake Enterprise IT for the Era of Cloud Enterprises are increasingly relying on cloud, which is being fueled by abundant bandwidth, the emergence of standards and the demand\nfor consumability. They are benefitting from cloud by using it to transform their IT and business processes into digital services, to reinvent their core business processes and to drive innovation.\nEnterprises are integrating public and private clouds with\nback-end systems to create hybrid, dynamic environments. They will increasingly need to manage their cloud environments with the same rigor as an on-premise datacenter. Therefore, IBM's strategy is to\nremake enterprise IT 1 for\nthe era of cloud. The company has invested over $6 billion to acquire more than 15 companies related to cloud, and is investing more than $1\u00a0billion to expand its global footprint to 40\ndatacenters worldwide. IBM now has more than 100 SaaS offerings, and IBM cloud supports 24 of the top 25\u00a0Fortune 500 companies. All of this drove $4.4\u00a0billion of revenue for cloud-based\nsolutions in 2013. 3. Enable \"Systems of Engagement\" for Enterprises and Lead by Example. Social, mobile and unprecedented access to data are changing how individuals are understood and engaged. A new class of individual is\nemerging: one that is empowered with knowledge, enriched by networks and expects value in return for its information. Enterprises must create a systematic approach to engage this new class of\nindividual and increase its speed and responsiveness by becoming mobile. Interactions need to be personalized to offer more value. In addition, enterprises will benefit from securing information and\nincreasing trust. Therefore, IBM's strategy is to enable \"systems of engagement\" for enterprises; and the company is leading by example. IBM has acquired 20 companies related to mobile, social and\nsecurity. IBMers are collaborating in more than 200,000 internal social communities and 85\u00a0percent of IBM's sellers use the company's Sales Connect portal. In 2013, the company's mobile, social\nand security portfolio generated double-digit revenue growth with mobile increasing 69 percent, security 19 percent and social business 45\u00a0percent. To\ncapture the opportunities arising from these strategic imperatives, IBM is focused on four key growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, Business Analytics, Cloud Computing and Growth\nMarkets. Smarter Planet Smarter Planet is IBM's strategy to lead in a technology-enabled world that is more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent than\never before, allowing people and organizations to address significant business and societal challenges. At the heart of this strategy are solutions that drive innovation and outcomes for\nclients\u2014extending the boundaries of\nbusinesses, industries and communities. It is about helping the company's clients become better at what they do for their customers. IBM does this through advanced, integrated solutions based on\ncapabilities such as analytics for business and physical systems, cloud computing, mobile, social business and business process management. IBM\ncontinues to deepen its commitment to delivering on the promise of Smarter Planet for both line of business executives (CFOs, CHROs, CMOs, etc.) as well as IT executives across a\nbroad range of industries. IBM's industry-based approach and solutions are grounded in a deep understanding of the distinct set of challenges and opportunities that are confronting companies and\nexecutives in various industries. Whether 'smarter' means helping a bank to retain more customers through world-class mobile solutions, a hospital group to deliver highly individualized care\ncoordinated with social services, a local government to anticipate and alleviate traffic congestion before it happens, or a retail chain to provide a seamless customer experience across multiple\nchannels, IBM is developing and investing in a portfolio of replicable industry solutions to help clients achieve their goals and drive important outcomes for their customers. There\nare several areas of focus within the Smarter Planet strategy, including IBM's Social Business, MobileFirst, Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities initiatives. IBM's\nSocial Business initiative helps clients integrate social capabilities across core business processes to drive measurable business results. The Social Business initiative can\nunlock the intrinsic knowledge of people within an organization to help companies fuel customer-centric innovation, improve productivity and expand sales, loyalty and advocacy. To capitalize on the\nnew market opportunities that arise from a digital economy, IBM Social Business can let clients apply increasingly sophisticated analytics to gain actionable insight and to more effectively engage\nwith customers. Behavioral, human data is the newest form of data and can be used to build a stronger, more agile workforce and reinvent human capital management by applying behavioral sciences across\nthe talent 2 lifecycle.\nThe Social Business initiative is powered by world class IBM services and software, developed organically by IBM and through acquisitions. In\n2013, the company launched IBM MobileFirst, a unified approach to help clients and partners deliver best-in-class mobile solutions, take advantage of more commercial opportunities and\nprovide a superior customer experience. IBM has a breadth of expertise and technology to help organizations efficiently build and deploy mobile applications, maintain visibility and control over their\nmobile infrastructure, engage customers in context and transform the value chain in ways that can drive growth and return on investment. The company can help its clients achieve these goals through a\ncomplete portfolio of IBM mobile software, services and industry expertise. Throughout 2013, IBM invested in\ncore mobile enterprise capabilities such as IBM Worklight and IBM Rational, while rounding out its portfolio with strategic acquisitions such as Fiberlink, Trusteer, Xtify and The Now Factory.\nIntegrated with 270 patents in wireless innovations and strengthened by thousands of mobile specialists from IBM Mobile Enterprise Services and IBM Interactive, the company has already helped more\nthan 1,000 clients become more mobile enterprises. In\naddition to Social and Mobile, IBM's deep commitment to building a smarter planet can be seen in the ongoing efforts around Smarter Commerce and Smarter Cities. IBM's Smarter Commerce\nmodel can integrate and transform how companies manage and adapt their buy, market, sell and service processes to place the customer experience at the center of their business. IBM's Smarter Cities\ninitiative helps federal, state and local governments to make better decisions, anticipate issues and coordinate resources across agencies more effectively and deliver citizen-centric services that\ncan drive sustainable economic growth. Business Analytics Business Analytics is the category of software, systems and services that helps organizations take advantage of big data to make better\nand faster decisions and optimize processes. Big data includes both enterprise data, content and new data from both structured and unstructured sources: in previously unimaginable volumes (petabytes),\nwith huge variety (from blogs, tweets, pictures, videos and text), at high velocity (machine-to-machine data from the Internet of things) and with decreasing veracity (from uncertain or incomplete\nsources). Big data and analytics are core to achieving the Smarter Planet strategy, helping data-savvy, insight-driven leaders to infuse intelligence into business decisions, processes and client\ninteractions for faster actions and better outcomes. IBM\ncan serve new buyers and make new market segments by bringing IT to industries and professions that are being transformed by data. The company has a unique set of offerings and deep\nexpertise related to big data and analytics to help organizations: \u2022 Acquire, grow and retain customers by improving customer interactions, building long-term, profitable relationships and\nrealizing new value from customer sentiment. \u2022 Create new business models by tapping into information and insight to identify and explore strategic options for growth. \u2022 Transform financial management processes by improving enterprise agility, anticipating outcomes and driving business model\ninnovation through a discipline of performance. \u2022 Better monitor, predict and manage risk to build trust and value amidst uncertainty, by having confidence in their data,\nrisk exposures and ability to make risk-aware actionable decisions. \u2022 Optimize operations and counter fraud and other threats to reduce costs, increase efficiencies and productivity and\nimprove public safety. 3 \u2022 Improve IT economics by developing and enabling new value and agility at practically all levels of the organization and\nacross lines of business while helping keep costs low and profitability high. The\ncompany's approach to big data and analytics helps organizations to succeed in their industries. IBM recommends organizations do three things to be successful. First, build a culture that infuses\nanalytics everywhere. Second, be proactive about the privacy, security and governance of their data. Third, invest in the right platform and solutions to harness and analyze all of their data for new\ninsights and outcomes. IBM\nis committed to continually innovating across the spectrum of big data and analytics capabilities, solutions, systems, research, services, deployment and skills. For example, in\n2013, the company announced a breakthrough dynamic in-memory database technology called BLU Acceleration, predictive analytics for big data with IBM Analytic Catalyst, a PureData System for Hadoop\nthat marries IBM's enterprise-class Hadoop distribution (InfoSphere BigInsights) with the simplicity of an appliance, InfoSphere Data Privacy for Hadoop that provides security and protection for\nsensitive big data, a Watson Engagement Advisor solution to help transform how brands and their customers interact and new academic partnerships to help prepare students for the expanding scope of\ncareers in big data and analytics. Cloud Computing Cloud is a model for consuming and delivering business and IT services that can result in significant improvements in economies of\nscale and business agility and serve as a platform for business transformation. IBM has developed a portfolio of solutions, services and products that is helping thousands of clients adopt and\nleverage the transformative power of the cloud. IBM's breadth of capabilities gives the company a unique advantage to help clients think, build and tap into the cloud. IBM has the deep industry\nexpertise to help clients transform business processes, industry optimized software solutions to support business processes, software development platforms to create new cloud-based business\napplications and standardized infrastructure to run these applications. IBM\noffers a full array of cloud delivery models, including private clouds, public clouds and a hybrid cloud that includes a mix of both. The company enables clients to build private,\non-premises cloud-based environments that have the control, security and isolation required for their most mission-critical workloads. IBM also offers public cloud services, including the newly\nacquired SoftLayer platform that provides an infrastructure and ecosystem for middleware and applications. IBM's public cloud services can be simply provisioned as a self service, pay-as-you-go\nconsumption model. IBM's software defined environments can provide a seamless integration across private and public cloud models, with interoperability, portability and scalability to help clients\nrealize the full value of cloud. In\nthe new era of computing, IBM's plans to enable nearly everything as a digital service. During 2013, IBM made several cloud-related strategic announcements,\nnotably: \u2022 IBM's Watson technology is being made available as a development platform in the cloud to enable a worldwide community of\nsoftware application providers to build a new generation of apps infused with Watson's cognitive computing intelligence. \u2022 The acquisition of SoftLayer is enabling IBM to deliver industry-leading cloud solutions that offer the security, privacy\nand reliability of private clouds and the economy and speed of a public cloud. \u2022 New fast-start industry solutions, which are hosted on a private cloud using SoftLayer and offered as a managed service\nthrough Global Business Services, designed to meet growing demand from clients for rapid deployment, implementation and experimentation. 4 \u2022 The acquisition of Xtify\u00a0Inc., a leading provider of cloud-based mobile messaging tools that help organizations\nimprove mobile sales, drive in-store traffic and engage customers with personalized offers. \u2022 An open-standards IBM cloud platform that provides capabilities to power the next generation of cloud and mobile\napplication development and services. Growth Markets IBM continues to invest in growth markets where many countries and companies are embracing big data, mobile, social and cloud, often at\nfaster rates than mature countries. In China, for example, 32\u00a0percent of consumers make their purchases online, compared to only 14\u00a0percent of consumers globally. In Africa,\n18\u00a0percent of the continent's GDP is expected to be handled through mobile money transfers by 2015, while in Singapore, citizens spend 40 minutes on average each day on Facebook, compared to\nless than 25 minutes in the United States. IBM is helping clients in growth markets capitalize on these trends. For example: \u2022 In Mexico, IBM is using its analytics tools to enable Banorte-Ixe Bank to know and service its more than 13\u00a0million\ncustomers as individuals. \u2022 Using IBM's Big Data technologies and predictive analytics, Da Nang's (Vietnam) traffic control center is better\nforecasting and preventing potential congestion and better coordinating city responses to issues like accidents and adverse weather. \u2022 In Saudi Arabia, the company developed a public health solution for disease management that was implemented with the Saudi\nMinistry of Health to help manage the risk of infectious and communicable diseases across the Kingdom. \u2022 Faced with rising fuel costs and a goal to reduce greenhouse emissions, Jet Airways, India's premier international\nairline, turned to IBM to more accurately calculate, track and report aircraft emissions and reduce fuel usage. IBM\ncontinues to build out its shared services facilities and talent to support its clients in growth markets. In China, the company has increased its Big Data software skills, and it will leverage an\nIBM Integrated Managed Services Centre to capture the significant growth in cloud. In November 2013, IBM opened its first Africa Research Lab in Kenya, IBM's 12th\u00a0lab worldwide. The facility\nwill conduct applied and exploratory research into the challenges Africa faces, and deliver commercially viable solutions to help improve the lives of people across the continent. Summary IBM's strategy is one of innovation, transformation and a constant evolution to higher value. The company has steadily remixed its\nportfolio and business model to reflect its strategic beliefs and pursue its growth initiatives. IBM has a balanced history of exiting commodity businesses that no longer fit the high-value model\nwhile investing in strategic acquisitions and organic capabilities. In 2013, the company invested $3.1 billion for acquisitions, $3.8 billion in net capital expenditures and $6.2 billion in research\nand development. The company has acquired more than 150 companies since 2000 to bolster its portfolio in areas like big data and analytics, cloud and systems of engagement. As\nthe company looks ahead to 2014 and beyond, it will continuously transform itself to take advantage of new opportunities and pursue bold new plays in areas such as Watson solutions,\nnew offerings for big data and analytics, the mobile enterprise and high-value cloud services. IBM will continue to deliver differentiated client value based on its sustained investments in research\nand development, its engaged\nemployee base, industry expertise, global reach, and the breadth and depth of the company's technologies and capabilities. 5 BUSINESS MODEL The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to become more innovative, efficient\nand competitive through the application of business insight and IT solutions; and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic\ninvestments in capabilities and technologies that have superior long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nintegrated solutions to the company's clients. The\nbusiness model is resilient, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company continues to divest certain businesses and strengthen its position\nthrough strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas. In addition, the company has transformed itself into a globally integrated enterprise which has improved overall\nproductivity and is driving investment and expanding participation in the world's fastest growing markets. This\nbusiness model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term. BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND CAPABILITIES The company's major operations consists of five business segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, which the\ncompany collectively calls Global Services, Software, Systems and Technology and Global Financing. Global Services is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to\nclients.

Global Financing facilitates clients' acquisition of IBM systems, software and services. Global Financing invests in financing assets,\nleverages with debt and manages the associated risks with the objective of generating consistently strong returns on equity. The primary focus on the company's offerings and clients mitigates many of\nthe risks normally associated with a financing company. Global Financing has the benefit of both a deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services that are being\nfinanced. This combination allows Global Financing to effectively manage two of the major risks (credit and residual value) that are normally associated with financing. Global\nFinancing Capabilities Client Financing: lease and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms generally between one\nand seven years. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Global Services' long-term client service contracts. Global Financing also factors a selected portion of the company's accounts\nreceivable, primarily for cash management purposes. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial Financing: short-term inventory and accounts receivable financing to dealers and remarketers of IT products. Remanufacturing and Remarketing: as equipment is returned at the conclusion of a lease transaction, these assets are refurbished and sold\nor leased to new or existing clients both externally and internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment\nrevenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Systems and Technology and Global Services. Systems and Technology may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global\nFinancing to external clients. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its\nclients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Enterprise Transformation \u2022 Integrated Supply Chain 9 Sales and Distribution IBM has a significant global presence, operating in more than 175 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution\nof revenue.

IBM\nResearch also focuses on differentiating IBM's services businesses, providing new capabilities and solutions. It has the world's largest mathematics department of any public company,\nenabling IBM to create unique analytic solutions and actively engage with clients on their toughest challenges. In\n2013, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company for the 21st\u00a0consecutive year. IBM's 6,809 patents awarded in 2013 represent a diverse range of inventions poised\nto enable significant innovations that will position the company to compete and lead in strategic areas such as Watson, cloud computing and big data analytics. These inventions also will advance the\nnew era of cognitive systems where machines will learn, reason and interact with people in more natural ways. It was the most U.S. patents ever awarded to one company in a single year. 10 The\ncompany continues to actively seek intellectual property protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its intellectual property\nleadership. Some of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the\ncompany's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any\nparticular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Enterprise Transformation A key element of the company's strategy is becoming a Smarter Enterprise. The transformation to a Smarter Enterprise is built on the\nfoundation of internal transformation undertaken in the recent past, where IBM standardized business processes, drove enterprisewide transformation governance, implemented a global operating model,\ninstrumented data, and connected employees to drive collaboration across geographic and functional boundaries. The\nSmarter Enterprise is enabled through application of analytics, social, mobile and cloud tools, approaches and technologies. Analytics enable data-driven insights for faster, smarter\ndecision making. Social tools encourage peer-to-peer interactions, and allow data to be shared within and outside IBM in a social way. Mobile technology allows workers to work seamlessly from\nanywhere. Cloud infrastructure and services enable application delivery. Collectively these enablers allow IBM to make decisions differently, create value differently and deliver value differently,\nthereby improving employee engagement and client experience and ultimately driving better business performance. The company primarily reinvests the benefits of its enterprise transformation\ninitiatives in remixing its spending profile and resources to its higher growth, higher margin initiatives, in addition to improving profitability. Integrated Supply Chain IBM has an extensive integrated supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. In 2013, the company also managed\napproximately $20\u00a0billion in procurement spending for its clients through the Global Process Services organization. The supply, manufacturing and logistics and sales transaction support\noperations are integrated in one operating unit that has optimized inventories over time. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved sales force productivity and operational\neffectiveness and efficiency. Supply chain resiliency enables IBM to reduce its risk during marketplace changes. The\ncompany continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain providing a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM leverages\nits supply chain expertise for clients through its supply chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to\nlogistics. The\ncompany has expanded its use of analytics to measure, manage and fine tune its supply chain operations, which will help reshape its operations and create value for clients.

The key competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client\nservice, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in providing\nfinancial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of companies such as Cisco and HP and non-captive financing entities of companies such as General Electric Company and banks or\nfinancial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes\nwith local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

All\nexecutive officers are elected by the Board of Directors and serve until the next election of officers in conjunction with the annual meeting of the stockholders as provided in the\nBy-laws. Each executive officer named above has been an executive of IBM or its subsidiaries during the past five years. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets could impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for systems, software\nand services decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business processes and\nfunctions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in 14 quality,\nproductivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from certain segments of the\nIT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly\ncompetitive environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations or expand and scale them with sufficient speed, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market\nshare and its profit margins. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the\ncompany does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, our ability to attract and retain\ncustomers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in\nstrategic growth opportunities, including new and emerging markets and countries, to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in\nthe high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand for our other products or services. In addition, as the company expands to\ncapture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents\npotential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and\ncorruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual\nproperty could also be impacted by proposed changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing the ownership and protection of patents and other intellectual property. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business: The company's products, services, and systems may affect\ncritical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal\ninformation of employees, customers and others. In the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions,\nindustrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems, and\nthose of customers, third-parties contractors and vendors, and some of those attempts may be successful. Such breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification,\nmisuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems, theft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, system\ndisruptions, and denial of service. In the event of such breaches, the company, its customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well\nas the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding 15 to\nbreaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. As these threats develop and grow, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect\ndata\nand infrastructure. As a global enterprise, the company could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity,\nprivacy and data protection. Additionally, cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical\ninfrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. Moreover, the company's strategic growth areas involve new products, new\ncustomers, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products\nand services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic\nreview by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had\nlower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the\nfourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's\noverall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions,\ninflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and\nglobally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political\nclimates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products\nand services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision\nfor income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with\nlower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws,\nregulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject\nto the continuous 16 examination\nof its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these\nexaminations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the\ncompany's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse\nequity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a\nresult, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide\nincremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of operations and financial results\ncould be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the U.S. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated\ncompanies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which could\nnegatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding\npension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make\nestimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management\nDiscussion in IBM's 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2013 Annual Report to\nStockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual\nfinancial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company\ncompetes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave\nthe company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. Further, many of IBM's key personnel\nreceive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's\nequity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. 17 The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on single or a limited number of suppliers. Changes\nin the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company's\nsuppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect\nthe company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services\nand harm the company's reputation. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval.\nFunding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause\nand providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and\npenalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a\nsignificant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies\nand the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations\non the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks,\nincluding the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its\ncurrency and customer financing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and\naffect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company\nmay be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors and resellers to comply with all 18 applicable\nlaws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges\nand risks relating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic\nacquisition opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue\nimprovements and cost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the\nacquired business. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is\nsubject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained\nliabilities not subject to the company's control. The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175\ncountries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2013 Annual Report to Stockholders.\nThe company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled\n\"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. 19 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2013, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n18\u00a0million square feet, of which 16\u00a0million was owned and 2\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 3\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was\nbeing leased to non-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 2\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time,\nIBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when\nC-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates value for clients through integrated solutions and products that leverage: data,\ninformation technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for\nclients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation\nservices, cloud and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software; all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations. Strategy In a time of unprecedented technological change, IBM's strategy remains one of innovation and a constant drive to deliver higher value\nfor our clients. Key\ntenets of the company's strategy include: 1. Our strategic imperatives: Data, cloud and engagement are fundamentally\ntransforming the IT industry, the company and our clients' businesses. The tremendous growth of data is redefining today's competitive advantage. With data as the world's new \"natural resource,\" it is\nfundamentally transforming industries and professions. Yet as with all natural resources, only by refining data into actionable insights through analytics does it become valuable to the customer's\nbusiness. Cloud computing\u2014the delivery of IT and business processes as digital services\u2014offers opportunities for enterprises to reinvent not just their operations, but their\nentire business model and approaches to innovation. Engagement, including mobile and social technologies, is profoundly changing how people interact and the way work gets done. Finally, these\ntransformations are all supported and protected by high levels of security to ensure privacy and integrity of action. These three imperatives\u2014data, cloud and engagement\u2014are the\nfoundation of IBM's strategy today and its vision for the future. 2. Our unique strength: Our ability to connect new technologies with the\nsystems currently running today's enterprises is a key value-added service and market differentiator for IBM. Clients today want more than just adopting new technologies\u2014they want IBM to\nfuse new solutions with their existing systems. This \"bringing together\" is what the company calls Hybrid Cloud, and IBM is uniquely able to bring this value to its clients. 3. Our migration to higher levels of business value: Clients look to IBM to\nsolve their business challenges and opportunities rather than just providing technology. Our evolution over decades\u2014from hardware to software and services, and increasingly to full-fledged\nbusiness solutions\u2014reflects this critical shift in meeting client needs. IBM brings together the full breadth of its integrated offerings and industry expertise to be essential to its\nclients and deliver higher value. 1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Strategic Imperatives Data: transforming industries and professions Fueled by the proliferation of mobile devices, social media and the infusion of technology into virtually all aspects of business, data\nis the world's new natural resource. Without powerful analytics, however, it is just data. 1 Across\nall industries, enterprises are working hard to harvest new insights from the explosion of available data\u2014the new basis for today's competitive advantage. The\nadvantage for enterprises increases as they apply more sophisticated approaches to refining their data, turning them into insights that are actionable and add value. The advent of cognitive computing,\nwhich mirrors the same cognitive process that people use every day to understand the world around them, is profoundly redefining the relationship between humans and information. Cognitive systems\nlearn, navigate the language and protocols of expert communities, and communicate in natural language. IBM\nhas invested more than $26\u00a0billion, including over $17\u00a0billion on more than 30 acquisitions, to build its capabilities in big data and analytics. One third of IBM\nResearch's spending is focused on data, analytics and cognitive computing. In\n2014, IBM reported nearly $17\u00a0billion in business analytics revenue, and the company established the Watson Group to develop and commercialize cognitive computing innovations.\nThe company has committed a $1\u00a0billion investment to Watson, including $100\u00a0million dedicated to venture investments to support start-ups building cognitive apps through the Watson\nDeveloper Zone on Bluemix. The company is also making Watson more widely available through the Watson Ecosystem, which has grown to more than 160 partners with nearly 4,000 future partners seeking to\nbuild a new generation of cognitive apps. IBM also launched Watson Analytics, a breakthrough natural language-based cognitive service that provides instant access to powerful predictive and visual\nanalytic tools for businesses. Through Watson Analytics, IBM is extending analytics to the end user, not just the data scientist. IBM's goal is to give every business professional access to advanced\ncognitive-powered predictive analytics, coupled with new forms of data. In\naddition in 2014, the company made bold moves by establishing key alliances. In the data space, the company announced a ground-breaking partnership with Twitter to incorporate\nTwitter's massive data streams into IBM's cloud-based analytics, customer engagement platforms and consulting services. Enterprises will now be able to understand customer sentiment more deeply and\nanticipate sudden\nshifts in moods and markets by tapping into the Twitter data in powerful new ways. This capability will also allow clients to integrate Twitter data into their own cloud services and mobile apps. Cloud: reinventing IT Cloud is at the heart of the digital revolution. No enterprise is untouched by this revolution and the shifts are occurring rapidly. Enterprises\nare benefitting from cloud by using it to transform their IT and business processes into digital services. Much has been written about how cloud enables the sharing of\ninfrastructure\u2014this is true. However the real promise of cloud is much more profound. By forcing greater levels of standards up and down the technology value chain, new products and\nservices, and even entire business models, are able to be created in weeks rather than months or years. Cloud\nis a catalyst for innovation. IBM has invested more than $8\u00a0billion to acquire 18 companies related to cloud, and is investing more than $1\u00a0billion to expand its\nglobal footprint to 40 datacenters worldwide. IBM now has more than 120 software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings, and IBM Cloud supports 24 of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies, driving $7\u00a0billion\nof revenue for cloud-based solutions in 2014. \u2022 SoftLayer is the foundation for IBM's expansive infrastructure-as-a-service portfolio. It offers bare metal, private\ncloud and virtual server instances, which means it can cover many different workloads with unprecedented performance. SoftLayer offers a built-in private network which can handle huge capacity and\ngives users the ability to isolate public/private networks with controls for access and location of data. 2 \u2022 Bluemix is IBM's platform-as-a-service, built on the open standards foundation of Cloud Foundry and powered by\nSoftLayer's cloud infrastructure. SoftLayer offers cloud-based services, APIs and leading third-party services to developers in an integrated platform. Bluemix also allows them to mix and match\ndifferent tools to build apps in the cloud for mobile, Web, big data and analytics\u2014to name just a few. \u2022 IBM Cloud marketplace brings together the company's vast portfolio of cloud capabilities, delivering a self-service,\ndigital experience for developers, IT and business leaders. Visitors have access to a growing portfolio of cloud capabilities from IBM and qualified third-party vendors. Open integration including\npre-built APIs and hybrid options enable enterprise integration and composable business models. The\nIBM Cloud is the most powerful choice for enterprise-grade environments\u2014bringing unparalleled levels of security, performance and scalability. As a result, in 2014, IBM\nformed a strategic alliance with SAP to run its business applications on IBM's cloud. Engagement: re-imagining work Social, mobile and unprecedented access to data are changing how individuals and institutions work together. A new class of customer\nhas emerged: one who is empowered with knowledge, enriched by networks and expects value in return for sharing information. Enterprises must create a systematic approach to engage these newly\nempowered customers through more personalized interactions. IBM calls these new forms of interactions \"engagement\"\u2014and includes social collaboration and mobile\u2014both underpinned\nby high levels of security. In\n2014, the mobile, social and security portfolio generated double-digit growth with mobile revenue more than tripling versus 2013, security revenue up 19\u00a0percent and social\nbusiness growing 3\u00a0percent. In addition, IBM has acquired 23 companies related to mobile, social and security. On\nthe mobile front, IBM and Apple formed an historic partnership to transform enterprise mobility as we know it today. Together, IBM and Apple are joining forces to bring the\nease-of-use of personal apps to the enterprise environment. Together, the two companies are bringing the first wave of industry-specific apps to the market\u2014targeting the needs of\nindividual workers and helping to solve long-standing industry challenges. In\naddition, MobileFirst remains IBM's unified approach to help clients and partners deliver best-in-class mobile solutions, take advantage of more commercial opportunities and provide a\nsuperior customer experience. On\nthe social collaboration front, in 2014, IDC named IBM the worldwide market share leader in Enterprise Social Software for the fifth consecutive year. (1) In addition,\nIBM Verse, powered by IBM analytics and advanced search, is a new cloud-based messaging and social collaboration solution to manage the workday. It provides a seamless user experience across social\nnetworking, meetings, chat, documents, mail, and an array of intelligent, security-rich and engaging social apps on mobile devices or the Web. Security\nis a boardroom-level issue. It is also a key enabler for the continued growth of data, cloud and engagement. Enterprises\u2014and their clients\u2014demand that\nthese activities be secure as a requirement for participation. The\nmagnitude, sophistication and complexity of today's security threats are growing. With the proliferation of data on mobile devices, in social media and in the cloud, breaches are\nmore visible and (1) IDC\nWorldwide Enterprise Social Networks 2014-2018 Forecast and 2013 Vendor Shares, July\u00a023, 2014. 3 occur\non a heightened scale. IBM Security solutions use sophisticated analytics to identify and thwart attacks in realtime\u2014protecting our clients' information, processes and people. IBM\nSecurity brings to our clients high-end consulting, advanced fraud and threat protection, identity and access management, application and data security, mobile and cloud security,\nnetwork and end-point protection with services for cloud. 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Unique Strength Data, cloud and engagement are powerful forces changing the landscape of technology and businesses. However, enterprise clients need more. Enterprises need to\nbring this new world of technology together with the existing systems that currently run their businesses if they are to capture their full value. This combination is what we refer to as Hybrid Cloud. Without\nbringing these worlds together, these new technologies become \"islands\" within the enterprise. For example, a business that invests in a social media platform engages with and\ncaptures the sentiment of individual customers. These can be valuable interactions. However, much deeper insight into the needs and wants of an individual customer comes when combining the social\nmedia interactions with the historical purchase and engagement records of that customer\u2014as stored in existing systems. By combining these insights, the enterprise personalizes interactions\nin ways that are relevant and meaningful to that customer. IBM\nis unique in bringing this Hybrid world to its clients with our unparalleled strength in both the existing and the new worlds of IT. IBM\nsupports its clients' mission critical processes, and remains the \"go-to\" platform for the enterprise. For example, more than 90\u00a0percent of the top 100 banks and the top 25\nU.S. retailers run on IBM systems. In addition, nearly half of the Fortune 100 companies outsource IT operations to IBM. The company's leadership in enterprise computing provides the foundation for\nstrategic partnerships as leading companies want to work with IBM, as evidenced by the Apple, SAP, Twitter and Tencent partnerships announced in 2014. Combine\nthis with the company's strength in the new worlds of data, cloud and engagement\u2014and IBM brings a unique and important capability to the market. 3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Migration to Higher Value Technology by itself does not create value for a business. Technology enables a business to achieve its aspirations by facilitating richer interactions with\nclients and ecosystems, by unlocking deeper insight and by enabling faster actions. IBM\nhas continuously evolved its mission to deliver increasingly higher levels of business value to its clients. Starting primarily as a hardware company, IBM has added a rich portfolio\nof software and services to add higher value. This\nnext phase of IBM's transformation will realize the full breadth of the portfolio by bringing higher-value added solutions to our clients. Examples\ninclude: \u2022 Using predictive analytics to reduce customer attrition rates through the IBM Customer Data solution. \u2022 Detecting fraudulent claims before payments are made through the IBM Counter Fraud solution. \u2022 Preventing costly and unscheduled downtime of equipment through early detection of anomalies with the IBM Predictive\nAsset Optimization solution. 4 The\nfocus on integrated solutions will make IBM a stronger partner with its clients as the company takes another step in its continuous evolution to higher levels of value. Summary One constant throughout IBM's over 100-year history has been the need to continually transform the company in an ever-changing\nindustry. Our industry, our clients\u2014and IBM itself\u2014is in the midst of such a fundamental transformation. This\nis a transformation of unparalleled growth and promise: \u2022 The promise of technology to bring extraordinary levels of insight to human endeavors through advances in analytics and\ncognitive computing. \u2022 The promise of the cloud as a catalyst for innovation, freeing enterprises to focus more on the uses of technology rather\nthan just the technology itself. \u2022 The promise of enterprises engaging with their customers, their employees and their business partners through richer,\nmore personalized means. \u2022 All underscored by security to help protect the integrity of every interaction. We\nare excited about the prospects for growth and value for our clients\u2014and for IBM\u2014and we look forward to helping our clients transform their businesses for the\nfuture. Business Model The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to become more innovative, efficient\nand competitive through the application of business insight and IT solutions; and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic\ninvestments in capabilities and technologies that have superior long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nintegrated solutions to the company's clients. The\nbusiness model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing market and economic environment. The company continues to divest certain businesses and strengthen its position\nthrough strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas. In addition, the company has transformed itself into a globally integrated enterprise which has improved overall\nproductivity and is driving investment and expanding participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity. This\nbusiness model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term. Business Segments and Capabilities The company's major operations consists of five business segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, which the\ncompany collectively calls Global Services, Software, Systems and Technology and Global Financing. Global Services : is a critical component of the company's strategy of providing IT infrastructure and business insight and solutions to\nclients. While solutions often include industry-leading IBM software and systems, other suppliers' products are also used if a client solution requires it. Approximately 60\u00a0percent of external\nGlobal Services segment revenue is annuity based, coming primarily from outsourcing and maintenance arrangements. The Global Services backlog provides a 5 solid\nrevenue base entering each year. Within Global Services, there are two reportable segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services. Global Technology Services (GTS) primarily provides IT infrastructure and business process services, creating business value for clients\nthrough unique technology and IP integrated services within its global delivery model. By leveraging insights and experience drawn from IBM's global scale, skills and technology, with applied\ninnovation from IBM Research, clients gain access to leading-edge, high-quality services with improved productivity, flexibility, cost and outcomes.

Value is delivered through advanced capabilities in areas such as application testing and modernization, cloud application services, the company's highly differentiated\nglobally integrated capability model, industry knowledge and the standardization and automation of application management. Software consists primarily of middleware and operating systems software. Middleware software enables clients to integrate systems,\nprocesses and applications across a standard software platform to improve their business results, solve critical problems and gain competitive advantage within their industries. IBM middleware is\ndesigned on open standards, making it easier to integrate disparate business applications, developed by different methods and implemented at different times. Operating systems\nare the software engines that run computers. Approximately 70\u00a0percent of external Software segment revenue is annuity based, coming from recurring license charges, software sold \"as a service\"\nand ongoing post-contract support. The remaining revenue relates to one-time charge (OTC) arrangements in which clients pay one, up-front payment for a perpetual license. Typically, the sale of OTC\nsoftware includes one year of post-contract support. Clients can also purchase ongoing post-contract support after the first year, which includes unspecified product upgrades and technical support. Software\nCapabilities WebSphere: delivers capabilities that enable organizations to run high-performance business applications. With\nthese applications, clients can integrate and manage business processes across their organizations with the flexibility and agility they need to respond to changing conditions. Built on\nservices-oriented architecture (SOA), and open standards support for cloud, mobile and social interactions, the WebSphere platform enables enterprises to extend their reach and optimize interactions\nwith their key constituents. Smarter Commerce software helps companies better manage and improve each step of their value chain and capitalize on opportunities for profitable growth, efficiency and\nincreased customer loyalty. Information Management: enables clients to integrate, manage and analyze enormous amounts of data from a large variety of sources in order\nto gain competitive advantage and improve their business outcomes. With this approach, clients can extract real value out of their data and use it to make better business decisions. IBM's middleware\nand integrated solutions include advanced database management, information integration, data governance, enterprise content management, data warehousing, business analytics and intelligence,\npredictive analytics and big data analytics. Watson Solutions: the first commercially available cognitive computing platform that has the ability to interact in natural language,\nprocessing vast amounts of big data, and learning from its interactions with people and computers. As an advisor, Watson is able to sift through and understand large amounts of data delivering\ninsights with unprecedented speeds and accuracy. Tivoli: helps clients optimize the value they get from their infrastructures and technology assets through greater visibility, control and\nautomation across their end-to-end business operations. These asset management solutions foster integrated service delivery for cloud and datacenter management, enterprise endpoint and mobile device\nmanagement, asset and facilities management, and storage management. Tivoli includes security systems software that provides clients with a single security intelligence platform that enables them to\nbetter secure all aspects of their enterprise and prevent security breaches. Workforce Solutions: enables businesses to connect people and processes for more effective communication and increased productivity\nthrough collaboration, messaging and social networking 7 software.\nBy remaining at the forefront of collaboration tools, IBM's social business offerings help organizations reap real benefits associated with social networking, as well as create a more\nefficient and effective workforce. Rational: supports software development for both IT and complex embedded system solutions, with a portfolio of products and solutions\nsupporting DevOps and Smarter Product Development, transforming the way lines of business, development and operations work together to deliver innovation via software. Mobile: spans middleware and offers customers true end-to-end mobile solutions across platform and application development, mobile\nsecurity, and mobile device management. Leveraging powerful analytics and usage data, customers are provided with the ability to have more compelling interactions with their clients and workforce,\nincreasing touchpoints and deepening relationships. The mobile offerings provide the ability to increase workforce productivity through enhanced collaboration, improved knowledge sharing and increased\nresponse speed. In\nJanuary 2015, the company made several changes designed to more effectively align its key capabilities and resources to its strategic imperatives. These changes will enable the\ncompany to respond more quickly to critical client agendas and drive higher value. Across Software, the company is transitioning its portfolio to capture growth and continue to drive innovation. The\nfocus will be centered around analytics, security, and commerce\u2014similar to the action the company implemented in 2014 with Watson\u2014utilizing its software assets to improve speed\nand agility in bringing integrated solutions to its clients. Systems and Technology (STG) provides clients with innovative infrastructure technologies to help meet the new requirements of data, cloud\nand engagement\u2014from deploying advanced analytics, to moving to digital service delivery with the cloud, and securing mobile transaction processing. Approximately half of Systems and\nTechnology's server and storage sales transactions are through the company's business partners; with the balance direct to end-user clients. In addition, Systems and Technology provides leading\nsemiconductor technology, products and packaging solutions for IBM's own advanced technology needs. Systems\nand Technology Capabilities Servers: a range of high-performance systems designed to address capacity, security, speed and compute power\nneeds for businesses, organizations and technical computing applications. After the divestiture of the System\u00a0x\u00a0industry standard server business, the portfolio includes System z, a\ntrusted enterprise platform for integrating data, transactions and insight, and Power Systems, a system designed from the ground up for big data, optimized for scale-out cloud and Linux, and\ndelivering open innovation with OpenPOWER. The company is also a founding member of the OpenPOWER foundation, a group of industry-leading companies working together to develop high-performance compute\nsolutions based on the IBM POWER architecture. Storage: data storage products and solutions that allow clients to retain and manage rapidly growing, complex volumes of digital\ninformation. These solutions address critical client requirements for information retention and archiving, security, compliance and storage optimization including data deduplication, availability and\nvirtualization. The portfolio consists of a broad range of software defined storage solutions, disk and tape storage systems and Flash storage and solutions. Technology: the company's continued leadership in systems requires ongoing investments in semiconductor and material science research and\ndevelopment that drives innovation that matters for our clients. In 2014, the company announced a definitive agreement to divest its Microelectronics business, and manufacturing operations. This\ntransaction is expected to close in 2015. 8 Global Financing facilitates IBM clients' acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing\nsolutions in the areas where the company has the expertise. The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are critical to the end users' business operations. These\nfinancing contracts are entered into after a comprehensive credit evaluation and are secured by legal contracts. As a captive financier, Global Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its\nclient base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks, credit and residual value, associated with\nfinancing while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also maintains a long term partnership with the companies' clients through various stages of IT asset life cycle\u2014from\ninitial purchase and technology upgrades to asset disposition decisions. Global\nFinancing Capabilities Client Financing: lease and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms up to seven years.\nAssets financed are primarily IT products and services where the company has expertise. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Global Services' long-term client service contracts. Global\nFinancing also factors a selected portion of the company's accounts receivable, primarily for cash management purposes. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon\nmarket conditions. Commercial Financing: short-term inventory and accounts receivable financing to dealers and remarketers of IBM and OEM products. Remanufacturing and Remarketing: used equipment is returned from lease transactions, or may be surplus equipment internally or externally\npurchased. These assets may be refurbished or upgraded and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally or internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases\nto clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Systems and Technology and Global Services. Systems and Technology may\nalso sell the equipment that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients. IBM WORLDWIDE ORGANIZATIONS The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its\nclients: \u2022 Sales and Distribution \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property \u2022 Integrated Supply Chain Sales and Distribution IBM has a significant global presence, operating in more than 175 countries, with an increasingly broad-based geographic distribution\nof revenue. The company's Sales and Distribution organization manages the IBM global footprint, with dedicated country-based operating units focused on delivering unique value and superior experiences\nfor clients. Within these units, client relationship professionals work with integrated teams of consultants, product specialists and delivery fulfillment teams to enable clients' business growth and\ninnovation. These teams deliver value by understanding the clients' businesses and needs, and then bring together capabilities from across IBM and an extensive network of Business Partners to develop\nand implement solutions. By\ncombining global expertise with local experience, IBM's geographic structure enables dedicated management focus for local clients, speed in addressing new market opportunities and\ntimely investments in emerging opportunities. The geographic units align industry-skilled resources to serve clients' agendas. IBM extends capabilities to mid-market client segments by leveraging\nindustry skills with marketing, Inside Sales and local Business Partner resources. 9 The\ncompany continues to invest to capture the long-term opportunity in key growth markets around the world\u2014China, India and countries within Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe,\nthe Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The company's major markets include the G7\u00a0countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (UK)\nplus Austria, the Bahamas, Belgium, the Caribbean region, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests approximately 6\npercent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and mid-term\ninnovations. It contributes many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research also explores the boundaries of science and\ntechnology\u2014from nanotechnology to future systems, big data analytics, secure clouds and to IBM Watson, a \"cognitive\" learning system. IBM\nResearch also focuses on differentiating IBM's services businesses, providing new capabilities and solutions. It has the world's largest mathematics department of any public company,\nenabling IBM to create unique analytic solutions and actively engage with clients on their toughest challenges. In\nFebruary\u00a02015, the company announced a new IBM Research lab to be located in South Africa. This will be IBM Research's 13th global lab. In\n2014, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company for the 22nd\u00a0consecutive year. IBM's 7,534 patents awarded in 2014 represent a diverse range of inventions poised\nto enable significant innovations that will position the company to compete and lead in the emerging opportunities represented by cloud, big data and analytics, security, social and mobile. These\ninventions also will advance the new era of cognitive systems where machines will learn, reason and interact with people in more natural ways. It was the most U.S. patents ever awarded to one company\nin a single year. The\ncompany continues to actively seek intellectual property (IP) protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership.\nSome of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's\nvarious proprietary IP rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or\nlicenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Integrated Supply Chain IBM has an extensive integrated supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. In 2014, the company also managed\napproximately $21.8\u00a0billion in procurement spending for its clients through the Global Process Services organization. The supply, manufacturing and logistics operations are integrated in one\noperating unit that has optimized inventories over time. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved sales force productivity and operational effectiveness and efficiency. Supply\nchain resiliency enables IBM to reduce its risk during marketplace changes. The\ncompany continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain providing a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM leverages\nits supply chain expertise for clients through its supply chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to\nlogistics. 10 Utilizing\nanalytics, mobile, cloud and social\u2014with numerous projects, has allowed the integrated supply chain to drive positive business outcomes for the company and its clients. COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive\nenvironment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the\ncompany recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. Across\nits business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and\nservices; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and, service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and\nintegrate. The company has been executing a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic\ninvestments and strategic acquisitions. As the company executes its strategy, it enters new markets, such as cloud, business analytics and \"as-a-service\" solutions, which exposes the company to new\ncompetitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments. A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Global Services: The services segments, GTS and GBS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. GTS competes in strategic\noutsourcing, business process outsourcing, cloud services, and a wide range of technical and IT support services. GBS competes in consulting, system integration and application management services.\nThe principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry knowledge and experience, value and speed,\nprice, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in the services business include its global\nreach and scale, global delivery model, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise, services assets, an ability to deliver integrated solutions that can address clients'\nneeds in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. The company competes with broad based competitors including: Accenture,\nAmazon.com,\u00a0Inc. (Amazon), Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu, Google\u00a0Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft); India-based service providers; the\nconsulting practices of public accounting firms; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Software: The enterprise management software market is highly competitive, and increasingly technology companies are looking to implement\nsoftware solutions that will improve business outcomes for their clients. The key competitive factors in this segment include: functionality, ease-of-use, scalability, open standards, total\ncost-of-ownership and business value. IBM's leadership in each of these areas, and the ability to deliver solutions that drive business results, provides it with competitive advantages. The company's\nsoftware business includes middleware and solutions software offerings, delivered both on-premise and \"as-a-service\", and operating systems. The middleware portfolio is the broadest in the industry\nand covers both mainframe and distributed computing environments. The middleware portfolio also underpins IBM's solutions business and enhances the business value the company brings to clients. The\nsolutions portfolio provides comprehensive business and industry-specific offerings to new types of IT decision makers, such as chief marketing and procurement officers, chief information security 11 officers\nand chief financial officers. The depth and breadth of the software offerings, coupled with the company's global sales and technical support infrastructure, differentiate the software\nbusiness from its competitors. The company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio also contribute to this segment's leadership. The company's principal\ncompetitors in this segment include CA,\u00a0Inc., Microsoft, Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce.com and SAP. The company also competes with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or\nproduct markets worldwide. Systems and Technology: The enterprise server and storage market is characterized by technology and service innovation, with competition focused on value,\nfunction, reliability, price and cost performance. New entrants are leveraging innovation in technology and delivery of services to compete against traditional providers and offerings. The company's\nprincipal competitors include Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc. (Cisco), Dell,\u00a0Inc., EMC Corporation, HP and Oracle. Additionally, infrastructure-as-a-service providers such as Amazon Web Services who\noffer IT as a service and original device manufacturers who offer re-branded, lower cost system hardware alternatives compete with the company in this area. The\ncompany's investments in virtualization technologies, software optimization capabilities, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its\nsystems platforms to leverage the entire system, from the company's custom semiconductors through the software stack to increase efficiency, lower cost and improve performance, provide the company\nwith competitive advantages in this segment. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's\nleadership. Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. Global\nFinancing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client\nservice, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in providing\nfinancial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of companies such as Cisco and HP and non-captive financing entities of companies such as General Electric Company and banks or\nfinancial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

He was with Boston Consulting Group for 26 years and he\nfocused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets could impact the Company's\nBusiness: If overall demand for IBM's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue\nand profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business\nprocesses and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended\ngains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from certain segments of the\nIT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly\ncompetitive environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market\nshare and its profit margins. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the\ncompany does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain\ncustomers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in its\nstrategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing\nsegments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it\nneeds to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature\npresents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and\ncorruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual\nproperty 14 could\nalso be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business: The company's products, services, and systems may affect\ncritical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and\ntransmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including valuable intellectual property and personal information of employees, customers and others. In the current\nenvironment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and\nhuman or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems, and those of customers, third-parties contractors and\nvendors. Successful breaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems,\ntheft of sensitive or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, system disruptions, and denial of service. In the event of such breaches, the company, its customers\nor other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other\nfinancial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. The company experiences and responds to\ncybersecurity threats, although none has had a material adverse effect on the company to date. As these threats develop and grow, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further\ninvestments to protect data and infrastructure. As a global enterprise, the company could also be impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices\nrelated to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection. Additionally, cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information\ntechnology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, potential\nliability, and damage to brand and reputation. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. Moreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new\ncustomers, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products\nand services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic\nreview by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had\nlower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the\nfourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the quarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's\noverall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions,\ninflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and\nglobally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, 15 pandemic\nor other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and\nthe company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities\naround the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no\nassurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse\nequity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a\nresult, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide\nincremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of operations and financial results\ncould be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of\nunrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which\ncould negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2014 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding\npension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. 16 The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most\ncritical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2014 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0M,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2014 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and\nassumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company\ncompetes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave\nthe company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. Further, many of IBM's key personnel\nreceive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's\nequity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and\nafter GLOBALFOUNDRIES completes the acquisition of IBM's global commercial semiconductor business, it will become IBM's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain semiconductors.\nChanges in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the\ncompany's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient\nquantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials,\nor inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval.\nFunding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause\nand providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and\npenalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Customer Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a\nsignificant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies\nand the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations\non the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks,\nincluding the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of 17 non-performance\nby the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and customer financing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2014 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels could impact its Business: The company offers its products directly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors and resellers could subject the company to losses and\naffect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors and resellers may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company\nmay be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors and resellers to comply with all applicable laws and\nregulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks\nrelating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition\nopportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and\ncost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired\nbusiness. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to\nrisks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not\nsubject to the company's control. The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175\ncountries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2014 Annual Report to Stockholders.\nThe company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different 18 currencies.\nThe value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the\naggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls,\ngovernmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is\ndependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will\nbe able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2014, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n17\u00a0million square feet, of which 12\u00a0million was owned\nand 5\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 2\u00a0million square feet was vacant and 1\u00a0million square feet was being leased to non-IBM businesses. On October 20, 2014, IBM and\nGLOBALFOUNDRIES announced a definitive agreement in which GLOBALFOUNDRIES will acquire the company's Microelectronics business, including semiconductor manufacturing facilities in East Fishkill, New\nYork and Essex Junction, Vermont. The transaction is expected to close in 2015. Similar facilities in 14 other countries totaled 7\u00a0million square feet, of which 3\u00a0million was owned and\n4\u00a0million was leased. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as\nthe Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time,\nIBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when\nC-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today: The company creates value for clients through integrated solutions and products that leverage: data,\ninformation technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for\nclients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation\nservices, cloud and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software; all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations. Strategy IBM has transformed throughout its 100+ year history, and in its current transformation, IBM is leading a reordering of the technology\nindustry. In\n2014, the company's strategic imperatives were declared around the three main forces behind \"digital\": big data and analytics, cloud and engagement. Since 2010, IBM has invested\napproximately $30\u00a0billion in these areas, built out the IBM Cloud on a global scale, established the Watson Group, announced 50 acquisitions and entered into major partnerships, including the\nlandmark alliance with Apple to bring mobile to the enterprise. As\nIBM's clients transform, \"digital\" itself is not the destination, but a foundation to create a truly Cognitive Enterprise. This is resulting in new types of interactions between\npeople, organizations and machines. Through\nthese developments, IBM is emerging as more than a hardware, software and services company; IBM is transforming into a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. Key tenets\nof the company's highly differentiated strategy include: Cognitive Solutions: Cognitive, advanced analytics and key data are being integrated into all leading solutions. Cloud Platform: New solutions will be built on the IBM Cloud and the company's offerings will be cloud-enabled. The company is\ncontinuing to build\nthe premier cloud stack, developer environment and most secure hybrid cloud platform in the industry. Industry Focus: Because industry context is so important to the value of IBM's solutions, these solutions will be built for the needs\nof individual\nindustries and professions. Cognitive Solutions Since 2011 when IBM's Watson was introduced, IBM has been developing a new generation of cognitive systems that can see and analyze the\nmassive amounts of data that have previously been invisible to computers and enterprises. Cognitive systems have the capability to inject a kind of thinking ability into every digitalized object,\nprocess and service. IBM is on the forefront of deploying these systems and assisting clients to become truly Cognitive Enterprises. 1 Cognitive\nsystems are not programmed; like humans, they learn from experts, from every interaction, and from big data. They are enabled to learn by using advanced algorithms to sense,\npredict and infer. Ultimately they can augment human intelligence, allowing individuals to make more informed decisions. For\nthe past five years, IBM has continued to invest in Watson, including dedicating $100\u00a0million to venture investments to support start-ups building cognitive apps through the\nWatson Developer Zone on Bluemix. IBM is also making Watson more widely available through the Watson Ecosystem, which has grown to more than 500 partners. Paired\nwith Watson is the company's core big data and analytics business. IBM has invested over $15\u00a0billion in these areas since 2010, including over $7\u00a0billion on more\nthan 20 acquisitions. Nearly half of IBM Research's spending is focused on analytics and cognitive. IBM's\nleading-edge cognitive technology is only the starting point. The company is developing entirely new solutions businesses around that cognitive capability. In 2015, the Watson\nHealth unit was formed, which is IBM's first business unit designed around a single industry. Watson Health will create cognitive solutions that can better help doctors diagnose and anticipate\ndisease; it will recommend treatments that are tailored to individuals; and it will assist researchers to predict and prevent the next generation of diseases. Another\nset of cognitive solutions IBM is building is the Internet of Things (IoT). It is estimated that there are more than 9\u00a0billion connected devices operating in the world\ntoday, generating 2.5 quintillion bytes of new data daily. Watson IoT will bring the power of cognitive to the challenge of extracting and analyzing data embedded in intelligent devices in real time.\nIn addition, the recent closure of The\nWeather Company acquisition essentially expands the company's IoT platform; with one that collects, integrates and analyzes data from three billion weather forecast reference points, including\nsatellites, weather stations, airplanes, consumer apps and more for IBM and our clients. Through\nCognitive, IBM is ushering in a new era for the industry and for clients. Cloud Platform Cloud is at the heart of the \"digital\" revolution. No enterprise is untouched by this revolution and the shifts are occurring rapidly. Enterprises\nare benefiting from cloud by using it to transform their information technology (IT) and business processes into digital services. Cloud brings two compelling sources of\nvalue: \u2022 Innovation: In addition to cloud enabling the sharing of infrastructure, the real\npromise of cloud is innovation. By forcing greater levels of standards throughout the technology value chain, new products and services, and even entire business models, can be created in weeks rather\nthan months or years. \u2022 Hybrid: Data, cloud and engagement are powerful forces changing the landscape of\ntechnology and businesses. Enterprises need to bring this new world of technology together with their existing systems in order to capture their full value. Hybrid cloud brings together the back-end\nsystems infrastructure with the new strategic imperative \"digital\" technologies. Unless the new and traditional IT worlds are brought together, they will be isolated within the enterprise. IBM servers\nand storage can handle mobile transactions, compose and expose APIs and integrate across hybrid clouds to unlock new value from data. Making\napplications work across on-premise, public and private cloud environments is what hybrid cloud is all about. This requires a deep understanding of both traditional and new IT\nmodels, something that IBM is unique in bringing to its clients: 2 \u2022 In traditional IT, for example, the z Systems mainframe is used by all of the top 25 global banks and almost three-quarters of the top\n25 U.S. retailers. In addition, 70\u00a0percent of the top 25 Fortune 500 companies rely on IBM to manage their critical IT infrastructures. \u2022 In the new world of IT, the IBM Cloud has become the standard for enterprise-grade cloud\u2014bringing performance and the\nintegration across all IT. The company continues to build cloud into Global Technology Services' (GTS) large base of outsourcing relationships. \u2022 Each of these areas of IT requires uncompromising security. IBM Security brings to clients advanced technologies in fraud and threat\nprotection, identity and access management, application and data security, mobile and cloud security. IBM's systems are among the most secure in the world with advanced encryption, threat monitoring\nand tracking and behavioral analytics. Further, high-end security consulting brings the expertise of 6,000 dedicated security specialists. Built on big data analytics, IBM manages over\n20\u00a0billion security events per day on 2.5\u00a0million desktops for 12,000 clients through its Security Operations Centers. IBM's\nCloud platform includes: \u2022 IBM Cloud's Infrastructure-as-a-Service, which offers bare metal, private cloud and virtual server instances, enabling it to cover\nmany different workloads with unprecedented performance. IBM's platform also has tremendous geographic reach\u2014with 46 cloud centers around the globe. \u2022 Bluemix is IBM's Platform-as-a-Service, built on the open standards foundation of Cloud Foundry and powered by IBM Cloud's\ninfrastructure. Bluemix offers cloud-based services, APIs and leading third-party services to developers in an integrated platform. With $1\u00a0billion of investment, Bluemix is now the largest\nCloud Foundry development, has a significant number of services and is onboarding thousands of developers per week. \u2022 IBM Cloud Marketplace brings together the company's extensive portfolio of cloud capabilities, providing a self-service, digital\nexperience for developers, IT and business leaders. IBM has a significant number of Software-as-a-Service offerings and visitors to the Marketplace have access to an extensive and growing portfolio of\ncloud capabilities from IBM and qualified third-party vendors. \u2022 In 2015, IBM acquired: Blue Box Group,\u00a0Inc. (private cloud), Compose (database-as-a-service), StrongLoop,\u00a0Inc.\n(developer technology), Cleversafe,\u00a0Inc. (object-based storage), Gravitant,\u00a0Inc. (cloud brokerage) and Clearleap,\u00a0Inc. (cloud- based video). \u2022 The Weather Company acquisition in January 2016, whose dynamic cloud data platform powers the fourth most-used daily mobile app in the\nUnited States and handles 26\u00a0billion inquiries to its cloud-based services each day. This high-volume cloud platform processes, analyzes and distributes enormous data sets at scale in real\ntime. It adds an important dimension to the company's cloud platform. \u2022 IBM has entered into strategic partnerships all focused on bringing innovative data and analytics solutions to the market. The IBM\nCloud is the most powerful platform for enterprise-grade environments, bringing clients unparalleled levels of security, performance and scalability. Industry Focus IBM's solutions and platforms are most relevant in the context of each client's industry. General-purpose tools have their place, but\nthe company can unlock much greater value in building solutions for the specific needs of an industry. In this context, Industries are the focus. Watson\nHealth is an example of how the company is defining solutions around industry needs. In addition to Watson Health, in 2015, 20 new industry-specific analytics solutions were\nlaunched with 3 pre-built\npredictive analytics capabilities. These include solutions that allow clients to mine customer data for hidden insights for action, spot fraud or risk and predict vulnerabilities to preempt\nbefore they occur. These solutions, which are tailored specifically for retail, banking, telecommunications, insurance and others, will make it easier and faster for organizations to uncover and act\non critical business insights. In addition, IBM has announced over 100 apps through its alliance with Apple that bring value in the context of individual industries. Complementing\nthe power of the company's technology solutions is the industry expertise of IBM's Global Business Services consulting business. It is the combination of IBM's technology\nand services, which enable clients to achieve their business outcomes. Summary Each successive transformation of IBM has brought something new and innovative to the world. More than 50\u00a0years ago, IBM brought\nforward a revolutionary transactional computer called the mainframe. In the decades that followed, IBM commercialized the personal computer, created an industry around IT services and a software\nmarket around middleware. Each of these innovations is with the world today; they were built to last. The\ncompany's next chapter is ushering in an entirely new era of human-organization-computer interaction\u2014embodied in Cognitive Solutions and the Cloud Platform. Business Model The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to become more innovative, efficient\nand competitive through the application of business insight and IT solutions; and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through strategic\ninvestments in capabilities and technologies that have superior long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nintegrated solutions and platforms to the company's clients. The\nbusiness model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including the company's transformation into cloud and as-a-service delivery\nmodels. The company continues to strengthen its position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas while divesting certain businesses. In addition, the company is\ntransforming into a more agile enterprise helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity. This\nbusiness model, supported by the company's financial model, has enabled the company to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term. Business Segments and Capabilities The company's major operations consists of five business segments: Global Technology Services and Global Business Services, which the\ncompany collectively calls Global Services, Software, Systems Hardware and Global Financing.

IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and\nmidterm innovations. It contributes many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research also explores the boundaries of science\nand technology\u2014from nanotechnology and future systems, to big data analytics, secure clouds and advancing the world's first cognitive computing platform, IBM Watson. In\n2015, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company for the 23rd\u00a0consecutive year. IBM's 7,355 patents awarded in 2015 position the company to compete and lead in\nthe emerging opportunities represented by big data and analytics, security, social and mobile technologies. These inventions will advance IBM's cloud platform and the new era of computing in which\nmachines will learn, reason and interact with people in more natural ways. The\ncompany continues to actively seek intellectual property (IP) protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership.\nSome of IBM's\ntechnological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. While the company's various proprietary\nIP rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns\nor is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Integrated Supply Chain IBM has an extensive integrated supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. In 2015, the company also managed\napproximately $24\u00a0billion in procurement spending for its clients through the Global Process Services organization. The supply, manufacturing and logistics operations are seamlessly integrated\nand have optimized inventories over time. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved sales force productivity and operational effectiveness and efficiency. Supply chain resiliency\nenables IBM to reduce its risk during marketplace changes. The\ncompany continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain providing a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM leverages\nits supply chain expertise for clients through its supply chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to\nlogistics. Utilizing analytics, mobile, cloud and social\u2014with numerous projects, has allowed the integrated supply chain to drive positive business outcomes for the company and its\nclients. 9 COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive\nenvironment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the\ncompany recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. Across\nits business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and\nservices; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and\nintegrate. The company has been executing a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic\ninvestments and strategic acquisitions. As the company executes its strategy, it enters new markets, such as cloud, business analytics and \"as-a-service\" solutions, which exposes the company to new\ncompetitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments. A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Global Services: The services segments, GTS and GBS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. GTS competes in strategic\noutsourcing, cloud services, and a wide range of technical and IT support services. GBS competes in consulting, system integration, application management and business process outsourcing services.\nThe principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry knowledge and experience, value and speed,\nprice, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in the services business include its global\nreach and scale, global delivery model, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise, services assets, an ability to deliver integrated solutions that can address clients'\nneeds in any environment and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. The company competes with broad based competitors including: Accenture,\nAlphabet\u00a0Inc. (Google), Amazon.com,\u00a0Inc. (Amazon), Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft); India-based service\nproviders; the consulting practices of public accounting firms; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Software: The enterprise management software market is highly competitive, and increasingly technology companies are looking to implement\nsoftware solutions that will improve business outcomes for their clients. The key competitive factors in this segment include: functionality, ease-of-use, scalability, open standards, total\ncost-of-ownership and business value. IBM's leadership in each of these areas, and the ability to deliver solutions that drive business results, provides it with competitive advantages. The company's\nsoftware business includes middleware and solutions software offerings, delivered both on-premise and \"as-a-service\", and operating systems. The middleware portfolio is the broadest in the industry\nand covers both mainframe and distributed computing environments. The middleware portfolio also underpins IBM's solutions business and enhances the business value the company brings to clients. The\nsolutions portfolio provides comprehensive business and industry-specific offerings to new types of IT decision makers, such as chief marketing and procurement officers, chief information security\nofficers and chief financial officers. The depth and breadth of the software offerings, coupled with the company's global sales and technical support infrastructure, differentiate the software\nbusiness from its competitors. The company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent 10 portfolio\nalso contribute to this segment's leadership. The company's principal competitors in this segment include CA,\u00a0Inc., Microsoft, Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce.com and SAP. The\ncompany also competes with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets worldwide. Systems Hardware: The enterprise server and storage market is characterized by technology and service innovation, with competition focused on value,\nfunction, reliability, price and cost performance. New entrants are leveraging innovation in technology and delivery of services to compete against traditional providers and offerings. The company's\nprincipal competitors include Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc. (Cisco), Dell,\u00a0Inc., EMC Corporation, HPE, Pure Storage and Oracle. Additionally, infrastructure-as-a-service providers such as Amazon\nWeb Services who offer IT as a service and original device manufacturers who offer re-branded, lower cost system hardware alternatives compete with the company in this area. The\ncompany's investments in virtualization technologies, software optimization capabilities, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and the ability of its\nsystems platforms to leverage the entire system\u2014from the company's custom semiconductors through the software stack to increase efficiency, lower cost and improve\nperformance\u2014provide the company with competitive advantages in this segment. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio\ncontribute significantly to this segment's leadership. Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. Global\nFinancing's access to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client\nservice, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in providing\nfinancial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of companies such as Cisco and HP and non-captive financing entities of companies such as\nGeneral Electric Company and banks or financial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT\nequipment market.

Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets could impact the Company's\nBusiness: If overall demand for IBM's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue\nand profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business\nprocesses and functions to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended\ngains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from certain segments of the\nIT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation and by leveraging its investments in R&D. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly\ncompetitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts\nto maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted\nby many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its\nability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in its\nstrategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing\nsegments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it\nneeds to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced personnel, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature\npresents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from\nevolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its\ngrowth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual\nproperty could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business: The company's products, services, and systems may affect\ncritical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data,\nand personal information of employees, customers and others. In 13 the\ncurrent environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee\nmalfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services, and systems. The risk of such attacks to the\ncompany includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Successful\nbreaches could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive,\nregulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; and system disruptions or denial of service. In the event of such breaches, the company, its customers or\nother third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other\nfinancial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. The company experiences and responds to\ncybersecurity threats, although none has had a material adverse effect on the company to date. As the cybersecurity landscape evolves, the company may also find it necessary to make significant\nfurther investments to protect data and infrastructure. As a global enterprise, the company and its business practices related to data, including personal data, could also be impacted by existing and\nproposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection, and the potential impact to the company of any\nsuch laws or regulations, as well as potential security breaches, could become greater. Additionally, cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power,\ninformation technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial\nloss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases.\nMoreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's\nfinancial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the\ncompany's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned\nfactors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition,\nthe high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the\nquarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's\noverall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions,\ninflation and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and\nglobally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political\nclimates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products\nand services to its customers. 14 The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and\nfinancial condition in future periods. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities\naround the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no\nassurance that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse\nequity market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a\nresult, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide\nincremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results of operations and financial results\ncould be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases can be significant due to the level of insolvencies of\nunrelated companies in the country at issue. Currently, Canada, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom require that these premiums be paid directly by the company and not out of plan assets, which\ncould negatively impact the company's earnings. IBM's 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding\npension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most\ncritical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In 15 addition,\nas discussed in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal\nproceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company\ncompetes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of knowledge and skills as experienced workers leave\nthe company. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid. Further, many of IBM's key personnel\nreceive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's\nequity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and\nwith the completion of GLOBALFOUNDRIES' acquisition of IBM's global commercial semiconductor business, it became IBM's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain semiconductors.\nChanges in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the\ncompany's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely\naffect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company's products and\nservices and harm the company's reputation. Product Quality Issues could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and\nprocesses intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions or defects are experienced by customers, there could be\nnegative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may\nbe subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing\nthe customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could\nincur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant\npercentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S.\ndollar. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt\nand liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the 16 use\nof derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and\nfinancing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems could impact its Business: The company offers its products\ndirectly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem\npartners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable\nto keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure\nof third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses\nand affect its ability to bring products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks\nrelating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition\nopportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and\ncost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired\nbusiness. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to\nrisks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not\nsubject to the company's control. The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175\ncountries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2015 Annual Report to Stockholders.\nThe company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. 17 Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled\n\"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2015, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of\n9\u00a0million square feet, of which 8\u00a0million was owned and 1\u00a0million was leased. Of these amounts, 1\u00a0million square feet was vacant. The aggregate floor space in the United\nStates declined 8 million square feet compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to the divestiture of the Microelectronics business. Similar facilities in 14 other countries totaled 7\u00a0million\nsquare feet, of which 3\u00a0million was owned and 4\u00a0million was leased. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance and upgrading\nof facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM\nhas focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when\nC-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today\u2014the company creates value for clients through integrated solutions and products that leverage\ndata, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities\nfor clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT\nimplementation services, cloud and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software; all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations. Strategy IBM has a history of continuous re-invention, transforming itself throughout its 100-plus year history. In the past five decades alone, IBM has\nushered in the eras of the mainframe, the personal computer, IT services and enterprise software. In its current transformation, IBM is once again leading the reordering of the technology industry. A\nnumber of years ago, the company declared its focus on the strategic forces behind the \"digital\" revolution; data, cloud and engagement, driven by mobile and social, and underpinned by\nsecurity. Since 2010, IBM has invested approximately $40\u00a0billion in these areas, built out the IBM Cloud on a global scale and extended cognitive systems to numerous enterprises and industries.\nThe company made 55 acquisitions and has formed partnerships with organizations that are leading players in key industries. Because\nof this transformation, IBM today is much more than a hardware, software and services company; IBM is a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company, with a focus on industry\ncapabilities and expertise: Cognitive Solutions: With the highest level of intelligence that exists in technology systems, these solutions tackle challenges\nranging from\nanswering client inquiries to helping physicians fight cancer. Cloud Platform: IBM Cloud is the leading cloud platform for the enterprise, providing what enterprises need for speed, agility and,\ncombined with\nWatson, for cognitive capability. Industry Focus: As IBM brings higher levels of value to its clients, as its offerings are being built for the needs of individual\nindustries.\nHealthcare and Financial Services are two examples of the company's initial cognitive focus. Cognitive Solutions Since IBM's Watson was introduced in 2011, the company has been developing a new generation of cognitive systems that can see and analyze the\nmassive amounts of data that have previously been invisible to computers and enterprises. IBM's cognitive systems have the capability to inject a kind of thinking ability into every digitized object,\nprocess and service, and learn from interactions. IBM is on the forefront of deploying these systems and helping clients to embrace the cognitive era. 1 Cognitive\nsystems are not programmed; like humans, they learn from experts and from every interaction, and they are uniquely able to find patterns in big data. They learn by using\nadvanced algorithms to sense, predict and infer. Doing so, they augment human intelligence, allowing individuals to make faster and more informed decisions. Since\nWatson's debut, many technologies have entered the market under the banner of artificial intelligence. However, IBM's approach to cognitive systems is quite\nunique: \u2022 Highly adaptable intelligence systems: Watson has broad applicability and can help clients tackle challenges ranging from oncology to customer\nsupport. \u2022 Protect and respect client data: Watson learns through data, both public data as well as clients' private data. Clients choose whether their\ndata or insights are shared. IBM respects the clients' ownership and control of their own data. \u2022 Easy entry points: Watson's open APIs offer easy on-ramps to experiment with speech, vision and other data. \u2022 Trained in domain depth: Watson is trained to be an expert in industries and functional specialties. It augments the knowledge of\nprofessionals, giving them access to the insights of their best colleagues and the world's leading experts. \u2022 Transformational services: IBM's Cognitive Solutions and Watson Internet of Things (IoT) practices help clients build their cognitive\nstrategies. GBS provides outcome-focused methodologies, domain skills and deep industry expertise. Cloud Platform Cloud represents more than a new architecture for delivering infrastructure and applications as services; it is also a catalyst for innovation,\nspeed and agility. Cloud enables companies to focus on differentiating their strategies, capabilities and business models rather than on the underlying technology. The\nIBM Cloud brings a unique set of characteristics to clients: \u2022 It is a world-class cloud platform designed for enterprises, where security, reliability, scalability and performance are critical. \u2022 It is the industry-leading hybrid cloud, enabling clients to extend their existing IT investments, connecting valuable data and applications\nacross public and private clouds. \u2022 It is a world-class cognitive cloud platform with IBM Watson services that developers can embed into their applications to create\ndifferentiating customer experiences and powerful insights. The\nIBM Cloud has a strong global presence, with more than 50 cloud data centers around the world giving clients the flexibility to optimize the deployment of data and application, for\nperformance, security and compliance. The\nIBM Cloud is also continually expanding its base of advanced capabilities including cloud data services, cloud object storage, cloud video services, as well as Internet of Things,\nblockchain and analytics services. In 2016, IBM brought new cognitive solutions to professionals in marketing, commerce, supply chain and human resources, extending industry clouds to further\ndifferentiate its cloud offerings. Industry Focus To bring higher value to clients, IBM is providing solutions that are specific and tailored to challenges clients face in their industry, using\nthe power of IBM's advanced cognitive computing 2 capabilities\nbuilt on the IBM Cloud. In 2016, IBM deepened its commitment to delivering higher value in several key ways: \u2022 In the healthcare industry, IBM Watson Health combines the power of cloud and cognitive with value-based solutions to optimize performance,\nengage consumers, enable effective care and manage population health. Significant investment in the healthcare space, including the acquisition of Merge and Truven, has enabled the company to expand\nthe scope of solutions aimed at solving some of the most pressing health challenges. \u2022 IBM continues to partner with financial services clients to build a robust infrastructure addressing increasingly complex and fast-changing\ndemands. From preventing fraud to supporting cyber security efforts, IBM is becoming ever-more essential to the financial industry. \u2022 IBM offers analytics to help clients assess their risk and compliance against industry guidelines, and uses a cognitive approach to provide\ndeeper and faster findings. In late 2016, the company acquired Promontory Financial Group,\u00a0LLC (Promontory), one of the world's leading regulatory consulting firms. Promontory is training\nWatson to be a market-leading expert in the regulatory field, which will allow the company to deliver services at new levels of efficiency and transparency. \u2022 IBM is committed to blockchain to provide a highly secure method of facilitating multi-step transactions, reducing the number of disputes and\npoints of friction, including its participation in the Hyperledger Project. This cross-industry consortium is working to build the blockchain network in the cloud, doing for trusted transactions what\nthe Internet did for information, and setting industry standards for years to come. Blockchain will enable financial institutions to settle securities in minutes instead of days; manufacturers to\nreduce product recalls by sharing production logs along their supply chain; and businesses of all types to more closely manage the flow of goods and payments. IBM is working with companies ranging\nfrom retailers, banks and shippers to apply this technology to transform their ecosystems through open standards and open platforms. \u2022 IBM's Global Business Services consulting business, with broad expertise across industries and a strong global footprint and scale, provides a\nunique combination of technologies and services to help clients achieve their business outcomes. Transforming Core Businesses While the company is focused on cognitive solutions, cloud platform and industry, it is important to note cognitive, cloud and industry are\nbeing embedded across IBM's offerings. These core businesses continue to run clients' most critical business processes. IBM's hardware systems are being designed from the ground up to power the cloud\nand cognitive systems of the future. The company's technology services help clients move to the cloud, embedding cognitive capabilities tailored for their industry. The company's software offerings\nare simultaneously being made available for the cloud as well as being connected to the cloud where our clients choose to keep them on premises. Additionally, cognitive capabilities are being added to\nthese offerings to provide new levels of innovation. In short, all of IBM is transforming to support the way its clients are transforming. Summary Each transformation of IBM ushers in a new capability to the world. More than 50\u00a0years ago, IBM introduced the programmable era and\ntransformed the world's transactions through the mainframe. In the decades that followed, IBM commercialized the personal computer, created an industry around IT services and a software market around\nmiddleware. Each of these innovations remains essential to business and the world today. 3 The\ncompany's current chapter is ushering in an entirely new era of human-computer interaction, embodied in cognitive solutions and the cloud platform for the needs of industries. The\ncompany is embarking on an era where it will create new capabilities at speeds and depth never previously witnessed.

The company's Global\nMarkets organization manages IBM's global footprint, working closely with dedicated country-based operating units to serve clients locally. These country teams have client relationship managers who\nlead integrated teams of consultants, solution specialists and delivery professionals to enable clients' growth and innovation. These local teams develop deep relationships with their clients to bring\ntogether capabilities from IBM and its network of Business Partners to develop and implement solutions. By\ncomplementing local expertise with global experience and digital capabilities, IBM builds broad-based client relationships. This local management focus fosters speed in addressing new\nmarkets and making investments in emerging opportunities. The Global Markets organization serves clients with expertise in their industry as well as through the products and services that IBM and\npartners supply. IBM is also expanding its reach to smaller clients through digital marketing, digital marketplaces, inside sales and local Business Partner resources. IBM\ncontinues to invest to capture opportunities in key growth markets around the world\u2014India, China and Southeast Asia; Eastern Europe; the Middle East and Africa; and Latin\nAmerica. Major IBM markets include the G7 countries of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States (U.S.) and the United Kingdom (U.K.), as well as Austria, the Bahamas, Belgium, the\nCaribbean, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Israel, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. 7 Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests 6 to 7\u00a0percent of\ntotal revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and midterm innovations. It\ncontributes many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges.

In\n2016, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company for the 24th\u00a0consecutive year. IBM's 8,088 patents awarded in 2016 represent a diverse range of inventions in\nartificial intelligence and cognitive computing, cognitive health, cloud, cybersecurity and other strategic growth areas for the company. The\ncompany continues to actively seek intellectual property (IP) protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership.\nSome of IBM's technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business\nmodel, the company licenses certain of its intellectual property, which is high-value technology, but may be in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately\nexpands the customer base. This generates IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the company's various proprietary IP\nrights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or\nis licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Integrated Supply Chain IBM has an extensive integrated supply chain, procuring materials and services globally. Additionally, growth in client spend managed by IBM's\nprocurement organization continues to demonstrate clients' faith that IBM can reduce clients' cost through the transformation of source-to-pay operations. The supply, manufacturing and logistics\noperations are seamlessly integrated and have optimized inventories over time. Simplifying and streamlining internal processes has improved sales force productivity and operational effectiveness and\nefficiency. Supply chain resiliency enables IBM to reduce its risk during marketplace changes. The\ncompany continues to derive business value from its own globally integrated supply chain providing a strategic advantage for the company to create value for clients. IBM leverages\nits supply chain expertise for clients through its supply chain business transformation outsourcing service to optimize and help operate clients' end-to-end supply chain processes, from procurement to\nlogistics. Utilizing analytics, mobile, cloud and social\u2014with numerous projects, has allowed the integrated supply chain to drive positive business outcomes for the company and its\nclients. 8 COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive\nenvironment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the\ncompany recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. Across\nits business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and\nservices; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and\nintegrate. The company has been executing a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic\ninvestments, partnerships and strategic acquisitions. As the company executes its strategy, it has entered into new markets, such as cloud and cognitive, including business analytics and\n\"as-a-service\" solutions, which exposes the company to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments. A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Cognitive Solutions: The Cognitive Solutions segment leads the burgeoning market for artificial intelligence infused software solutions. Increasingly, technology\ncompanies are looking to implement software solutions that will take advantage of the massive amounts of data businesses hold in order to improve business outcomes for their clients. The Watson\nplatform is integrated throughout the Cognitive Solutions segment. Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability, representing a new era in computing. Delivered through the\ncloud, the platform analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns in three ways: by being\ntaught by its users, by learning from prior interactions, and by being presented with new information. Its\nkey competitive factors include a wide range of powerful cognitive services\u2014from conversation services and machine vision to deep learning. IBM is unique amongst its\ncompetitors in providing transparency so users and decision makers can see the data sources and training methods and thus have confidence in the recommendations. The insights produced by IBM's\ncognitive systems are trained and designed for specific industries including Health, Financial Services, Education, Retail and others. Specifically,\nCognitive Solutions includes solutions software, delivered both on-premise and \"as-a-service\", and transaction processing software. The solutions software portfolio, which\nspans Watson data management, analytics, security, and social capabilities, provides comprehensive business and industry-specific offerings to IT decision makers. IT buyers include chief information\nofficers as well as line of business buyers, such as chief marketing and procurement officers, chief information security officers and chief financial officers. The transaction processing software\nportfolio, mostly delivered on-premise, runs mission-critical systems in industries such as banking, airlines and retail. The\ndepth and breadth of the software offerings, coupled with the company's global markets and technical support infrastructure, differentiate its capabilities from its competitors. The\ncompany's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio also contribute to its differentiation. The company's principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet\nInc. (Google), Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon) Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc. (Cisco), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce.com and SAP. The company also competes with\nsmaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets worldwide. 9 Global Business Services and Technology Services & Cloud Platforms: The company's services segments, Global Business Services and Technology Services\u00a0& Cloud Platforms, operate in a highly competitive and\ncontinually evolving global market. The principal competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry\nknowledge and experience, value and speed, price, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in\nthese businesses include its global reach and scale, global delivery model, best-of-breed process and industry skills, extensive technology expertise, services assets, an ability to deliver integrated\nsolutions that can address clients' needs in any environment and with a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. Global Business Services: GBS competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. The company competes with\nbroad based competitors including: Accenture, Capgemini, Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu, Google, Hewlett-Packard (HPE) and Microsoft; India-based service providers; the consulting practices of\npublic accounting firms; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas.

This\nsegment also includes the company's Integration Software offerings. Integration Software helps clients address the digital imperatives to create, connect and optimize their\napplications, data and infrastructure on their journey to become cognitive businesses. The company competes with Amazon,\nBMC, Microsoft, Oracle, VMWare as well as companies that primarily focus on niche solutions and offerings. Systems: The enterprise server and storage market is characterized by competition in technology and service innovation focused on value, function,\nreliability, price and cost performance. The company's principal competitors include Dell Technologies, HPE, Intel, Pure Storage, Oracle, and lower cost original device manufacturer systems that are\noften re-branded. Also, alternative as-a-service providers are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery both to compete with traditional providers and to offer new routes to market for\nserver and storage systems. These alternative providers include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM's own cloud-based services. The\ncompany gains advantage and differentiation through investments in higher value capabilities\u2014from semiconductor through software stack innovation\u2014that\nincrease efficiency, lower cost and improve performance. The company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's\nleadership across areas as diverse as high performance computing, virtualization technologies, software optimization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and open\ntechnologies like interconnect standards to be leveraged by broad ecosystems. 10 Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. Global Financing's\naccess to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures provide a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include price, IT product expertise, client service,\ncontract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in providing\nfinancial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of IT companies such as Cisco and HP, non-captive financing entities of companies such as General Electric Company and banks or\nfinancial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local\nand regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

He was with Boston Consulting Group for 26 years and he\nfocused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets could impact the Company's\nBusiness: If overall demand for IBM's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue\nand profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business\nprocesses, functions and technologies to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield\ntheir intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from certain segments of the\nIT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue\nits cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the\ncompany could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. In addition, IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and\noverall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive\nleader. If the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in its\nstrategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share 12 gains.\nClient adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and\nprofitability for our other products or services. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it needs to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and\nexperienced personnel, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature presents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from\nevolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and corruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its\ngrowth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual\nproperty could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business: The company's products, services, and systems may affect\ncritical third party operations or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data,\nand personal information of employees, customers and others. In the current environment there are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists,\nstate-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and\ndata protection issues is increasingly challenging and may have impacts on the company's business, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. As the company's business focus\non data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the company's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. The General Data Protection Regulation that will\ncome into force in the European Union in May 2018 will cause the company to incur additional compliance costs. Computer\nhackers and others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or others to disclose\ninformation or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of\ncustomers,\ncontractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to,\ndisclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information\nand intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware or other attacks; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denial of service. In the event of\nsuch actions, the company, its customers or other third parties could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or\npotential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could\nbe significant. The company experiences and responds to cybersecurity threats, although none has had a material adverse effect on the company to date. As the company's business and the cybersecurity 13 landscape\nevolve, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers will also\ndepend on factors such as actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in\ndisruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party\noperations or services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases.\nMoreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's\nfinancial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the\ncompany's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned\nfactors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition,\nthe high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, may affect IBM's ability to successfully ship all orders before the end of the\nquarter. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's\noverall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic\nand political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in\ntrade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional\nregulatory or other risks. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural\ndisasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and the company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of 14 operations\nand financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing\ninternational tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's\nincome taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition,\nIBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will\nnot have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse\nfinancial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may\nhave an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company's financial results in any period could be\nnegatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which\ncould negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the\nUnited States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information\nabout potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most\ncritical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0M,\n\"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and\nassumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Personnel and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled personnel, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company\ncompetes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition,\nas global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key personnel receive a\ntotal compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the 15 company's\nuse, and the value, of the company's equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and\nwith the completion of GLOBALFOUNDRIES' acquisition of IBM's global commercial semiconductor business in 2015, it became IBM's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain\nsemiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the\nfailure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations\ncould adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the\ncompany's products and services and harm the company's reputation. Product Quality Issues could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and\nprocesses intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by\ncustomers, there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval.\nFunding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause\nand providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and\npenalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of operations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant\npercentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S.\ndollar. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt\nand liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of\nderivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if 16 future\nactual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's\nconsolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems could impact its Business: The company offers its products\ndirectly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem\npartners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable\nto keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party\ndistributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its\nability to bring products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks\nrelating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition\nopportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and\ncost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired\nbusiness. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to\nrisks, including risks related to\nthe terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175\ncountries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2016 Annual Report to Stockholders.\nThe company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other\ncontingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled\n\"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of 17 IBM\ncommon stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not\nmake a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: At December\u00a031, 2016, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 8\u00a0million\nsquare feet, of which 7\u00a0million was owned and 1\u00a0million was leased. Similar facilities in 16 other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 2\u00a0million was owned and\n4\u00a0million was leased.

The\n2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Committee\"), and that Committee may delegate to officers of\nthe company certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not\ntransferable or assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the\nCommittee. If\nthe employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled\nimmediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise.

The terms\nand conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM\nhas focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when\nC-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today\u2014the company creates value for clients through integrated solutions and products that leverage\ndata, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities\nfor clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT\nimplementation services, cloud and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software; all bolstered by one of the world's leading research organizations. Strategy The IBM strategy starts with its clients. As\na uniquely integrated technology and services company, IBM helps clients change the way the world works by building smarter businesses. IBM's\nclients include many of the world's most successful enterprises. These clients are at an inflection point, facing tremendous new opportunity and incredible competition. Digital\ntechnologies are unlocking unparalleled insight from previously inaccessible data. Work processes are being reimagined for speed and vastly smarter decision-making. To\nwin in these disruptive times requires that businesses learn\u2014learn by extracting insights from their data and by applying those insights to how work is done. Smarter\nbusinesses do this faster and more effectively supported by IBM's combination of Innovative Technology , Industry Expertise and Trust\nand Security . The\ncompany's capabilities include: Cloud Cloud is enabling the emergence of platforms through standardization, agility and innovation in both IT and business processes. Enterprise cloud\nis very different from consumer cloud: enterprises must bridge together mission-critical assets from on-premise systems with private cloud and public cloud. Hybrid cloud technology provides that\nbridge. All three must coexist and interoperate as a single platform. The\nIBM Cloud is uniquely: \u2022 Built for all applications: Applications require data. That data is in on-premise systems, in private clouds and in the public cloud. The IBM\nCloud enables one data platform that, regardless of data's location, can run all applications. IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities make this single platform operate seamlessly. \u2022 Artificial intelligence (AI)-ready: The IBM Cloud is built from the ground up to handle the demanding data and computational requirements\nof\u00a0AI. \u2022 Secure to the Core: IBM has a long history of helping clients keep data and transactions secure. Security is even more important in an\nincreasingly connected world, and IBM has extended this unparalleled level of security to the cloud. For example, IBM's cybersecurity offerings act as a business immune system, with AI technology at\nits core, delivered from the IBM Cloud. These 1 systems\nhelp to defend and respond to cyber-attacks across an organization's data, applications, mobile and endpoint devices. The\nIBM Cloud is delivered with leading edge technology, including: \u2022 Modern infrastructure: IBM's systems, including servers, storage and operating system software, have been refreshed and redesigned for cloud\nand enterprise AI workloads. IBM's new z14 is the world's first system to offer pervasive encryption of data without requiring changes to applications, and with no performance degradation. With IBM's\nsystems, clients can build an IT infrastructure that is optimized for the scalability, reliability and growth that businesses need in today's data-driven\nworld. \u2022 Future infrastructure: The Q Network on the IBM Cloud enables clients around the world to explore quantum computing capabilities. IBM is the\nleader in quantum computing. Clients are signing on to explore how to overcome foreseen constraints in traditional computing models. AI and Data Artificial intelligence can help clients extract insight and make intelligent decisions from data. Like cloud, enterprise AI is very different\nfrom consumer AI. Enterprise applications deal with more complex use cases that benefit from expert knowledge, such as in healthcare or in the identification of business risk. Enterprise AI\napplications are trained by expert data, through data sets of all sizes and with more specialization than those in the general-knowledge consumer world. IBM AI\u2014through the Watson\nplatform: \u2022 Learns more from less data: The ability to extract deep insights from both large and small data sets is essential for enterprise applications.\nWatson excels at this and can produce more insights with less data than other AI systems. That means clients can get started more quickly and begin to gain experience deploying AI in the enterprise. \u2022 Protects clients' insights: While Watson builds on cumulative experience and knowledge, IBM recognizes that data and insights are clients' most\nimportant assets and a true competitive advantage. Watson is built to safeguard this type of information. \u2022 Reimagines your workflows: Watson has been built for\u2014and trained in\u2014areas requiring deep expertise. Watson brings AI to\nprofessionals so that work can be done more efficiently, and even more importantly, can improve as the systems learn from the data. Solutions Creating smarter businesses requires reimagining a company's core processes\u2014for example, in healthcare, managing risk or optimizing\na supply chain. In addition to building solutions based on IBM's experience, IBM is also creating a series of AI solutions\u2014cognitive solutions\u2014that embed artificial\nintelligence and data to change how work is done. Examples include: \u2022 Global Industry Platforms: provides cognitive, analytics, security and cloud technology in comprehensive industry-specific platforms to remove\nmuch of the cost and complexity of delivering core business functions. For example: Banking, wealth management, and insurance are some of the areas poised for dramatic change by using cognitive and AI\nsolutions from IBM Watson Financial Services. Watson Health provides technology and expertise to empower leaders, advocates and influencers in health to accelerate discovery, make essential\nconnections and gain confidence on their path to solving the world's biggest health challenges. \u2022 Blockchain Solutions: IBM is working with clients and developers across multiple industries to use blockchain to transform how business is done\nin areas such as banking and financial services and supply chain. For example, blockchain technology can be used to digitize global trade 2 processes,\nproviding a more efficient and secure method of moving goods across borders and trading zones. \u2022 Watson IoT: includes both a cloud-based platform and industry solutions infused with AI, helping organizations mine intelligence from billions\nof connected devices. Enterprise Services Through Global Business Services and Global Technology Services, IBM has helped the world's most successful enterprises transition from era to\nera. Using proven methods, IBM Services bring globally delivered outcomes using proven methods by focusing on: \u2022 Digital Reinvention for growth: a unique framework for business transformation focused on growth opportunities. \u2022 End-to-end Services integration: Global Technology Services brings the ability to connect previously disconnected parts of an organization. By\nembedding Watson into these mission critical services, new levels of quality, resiliency and automation are achieved. \u2022 Pragmatic journey to Cloud and AI: Global Business Services brings its deep experience when guiding clients through the journey to cloud and\nAI. Clients gain from the thorough understanding of technology and the best ways to utilize it. As\nclients reinvent their businesses to be smarter, they need all of this to work together. This is what they expect from IBM, what they need from IBM and what sets IBM apart. *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* Responsible\nstewardship is an enduring principle that underscores all IBM endeavors. While IBM is constantly ushering in new technology it does so\nby: \u2022 Leading in data responsibility, ethics and transparency; \u2022 Preparing workforces of the world; \u2022 Continuing the company's century-long commitment to diversity and inclusion, and \u2022 Remaining grounded in a set of enduring IBM Values: \u2022 Dedication to every client's success \u2022 Innovation that matters\u2014for our company and for the world \u2022 Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships IBM\nhas built a reputation and track record of trust with its clients for more than a century. IBM safeguards a client's privacy, data and insights. For example, IBM was one of the first\ncompanies to appoint a Chief Privacy Officer, to develop and publish a genetics privacy policy, to be certified under the APEC Cross Borders Privacy Rules system and to sign the EU Data Protection\nCode of Conduct for Cloud Service Providers. *\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* This\nis an era where being faster, more productive and lower cost is important but frankly not enough. To win, a business must be smarter: Being smarter means having deeper expertise,\nextracting better insights from data and being capable of rapidly changing the way in which one does work. This\nis core to the strategy of IBM's clients and is at the heart of the IBM strategy. Business Model The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to move from one era to the next by bringing\ntogether innovative technology and industry expertise, and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through 3 strategic\ninvestments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients.

IBM Credit, through its financing solutions, facilitates IBM clients' acquisition of information technology systems, software and services in the areas\nwhere the company has the expertise. The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are critical to the end users' business operations. The company conducts a comprehensive\ncredit evaluation of its clients prior to extending financing. As a captive financier, Global Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products\nand services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated with financing, credit and residual value, while generating strong returns on equity.\nGlobal Financing also maintains a long-term partnership with the company's clients through various stages of the IT asset life cycle\u2014from initial purchase and technology upgrades to asset\ndisposition decisions. Global Financing Capabilities Client Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms up to seven years. Assets\nfinanced are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where the company has expertise. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Technology Services\u00a0& Cloud Platforms'\nlong-term client service contracts. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial\nFinancing: short-term working capital financing to suppliers, distributors and resellers of IBM and OEM products and services. This includes internal activity where Global\nFinancing factors a selected portion of the company's accounts receivable primarily for cash management purposes, at arm's-length rates. 6 Remanufacturing\nand Remarketing: assets include used equipment returned from lease transactions, or used and surplus equipment acquired internally or externally. These assets may be\nrefurbished or upgraded and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally or internally.

Systems may also sell the equipment\nthat it purchases from Global Financing to external clients. IBM Worldwide Organizations The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Global Markets \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property Global Markets IBM has a global presence, operating in more than 175 countries with a broad-based geographic distribution of revenue. The company's Global\nMarkets organization manages IBM's global footprint, working closely with dedicated country-based operating units to serve clients locally. These country teams have client relationship managers who\nlead integrated teams of consultants, solution specialists and delivery professionals to enable clients' growth and innovation. By\ncomplementing local expertise with global experience and digital capabilities, IBM builds deep and broad-based client relationships. This local management focus fosters speed in\nsupporting clients, addressing new markets and making investments in emerging opportunities. The Global Markets organization serves clients with expertise in their industry as well as through the\nproducts and services that IBM and partners supply. IBM is also expanding its reach to new and existing clients through digital marketplaces, digital sales and local Business Partner resources. Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests 7 to 8\u00a0percent of\ntotal revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and mid-term innovations. It\ndelivers many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in artificial\nintelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, security, cloud, nanotechnology, silicon and post-silicon computing architectures and more\u2014applying these technologies across industries\nincluding healthcare, IoT, education and financial services. In\n2017, for the 25th\u00a0consecutive year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBM's 9,043 patents awarded in 2017 represent a diverse range of inventions in\nartificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and other strategic growth areas for the company. The\ncompany continues to actively seek IP protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership. Some of IBM's\ntechnological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business model, the\ncompany licenses certain of its intellectual property, which is high-value technology, but may be in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands\nthe customer base. This would generate IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the company's various proprietary IP\nrights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or\nis licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. 7 COMPETITION The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive\nenvironment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across its business segments, the\ncompany recognizes hundreds of competitors worldwide. Across\nits business, the company's principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; its broad range of capabilities, products and\nservices; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and\nintegrate. The company has been executing a strategy to transform its business, including shifting to higher value market segments and offerings and increasing its capabilities through organic\ninvestments, partnerships and strategic acquisitions. As the company executes its strategy, it has entered into new markets, such as cloud and cognitive, including business analytics and\n\"as-a-service\" solutions, which exposes the company to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of its business segments. A\nsummary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Cognitive Solutions: The Cognitive Solutions segment leads the burgeoning market for artificial intelligence infused software solutions. Increasingly, technology\ncompanies are looking to implement software solutions that will take advantage of the massive amounts of data businesses hold in order to improve business outcomes for their clients. The Watson\nplatform is integrated throughout the Cognitive Solutions segment. Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability, representing a new era in computing. Delivered through the\ncloud, the platform analyzes data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns in three ways: by being taught by its users,\nby learning from prior interactions, and by being presented with new information. The\nsegment's key competitive factors include a wide range of powerful Watson AI services\u2014machine learning to deep learning. IBM is unique in that it allows clients to retain\nownership of their data and AI insights, trains with small specialized data sets, and is focused on embedding AI into business workflows. The insights produced by IBM's cognitive systems are trained\nand designed for specific industries including Health, Financial Services, Education, Retail and others. Specifically,\nCognitive Solutions includes solutions software, delivered both on-premise and \"as-a-Service\", and transaction processing software. The solutions software portfolio, which\nspans data management, analytics, security, and social capabilities, provides comprehensive business and industry-specific offerings to IT decision makers. IT buyers include chief information officers\nas well as line of business buyers, such as chief marketing and procurement officers, chief information security officers and chief financial officers. The transaction processing software portfolio,\nmostly delivered on-premise, runs mission-critical systems in industries such as banking, airlines and retail. The\ndepth and breadth of the software offerings, coupled with the company's global markets and technical support infrastructure, differentiate its capabilities from its competitors. The\ncompany's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio also contribute to its differentiation. The company's principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet\nInc. (Google), Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc. (Cisco), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce.com and SAP. The company also competes with\nsmaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets worldwide. 8 Global Business Services and Technology Services & Cloud Platforms: The company's services segments, Global Business Services and Technology Services\u00a0& Cloud Platforms, operate in a highly competitive and\ncontinually evolving global market. Competitive factors in these business segments include: technical skills and capabilities, innovative service and product offerings, industry knowledge and\nexperience, value and speed, price, client relationships, quality of sales and delivery, reliability, security and the availability of resources. The company's competitive advantages in these\nbusinesses comes from its ability to deliver integrated solutions that address clients' needs, leveraging cloud, automation and AI, its global reach and scale, a global delivery model, best-of-breed\nprocess and industry skills, extensive expertise in technology and innovation, services assets, and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. The IBM Cloud\nis built for the enterprise-designed for all data, AI-ready and secure to the core. Global Business Services: GBS competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. The company competes with\nbroad based competitors including: Accenture, Capgemini, DXC Technology (DXC), Fujitsu, Google and Microsoft; India-based service providers; the consulting practices of public accounting firms; and\nmany companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Technology Services & Cloud Platforms: Technology Services & Cloud Platforms competes in strategic outsourcing, cloud services, and a wide range of technical and IT support services.\nThe company competes with broad based competitors including: Amazon, DXC, Fujitsu, Google, Microsoft and Oracle; India-based service providers; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets\nor niche service areas. This\nsegment also includes the company's Integration Software offerings. Integration Software helps clients address the digital imperatives to create, connect and optimize their\napplications, data and infrastructure on their journey to become cognitive businesses. The company competes with Amazon,\nBMC, Microsoft, Oracle, VMWare as well as companies that primarily focus on niche solutions and offerings. Systems: The enterprise server and storage market is characterized by competition in technology and service innovation focused on value, function,\nreliability, price and cost performance. The company's principal competitors include Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel, Pure Storage, Oracle, and lower cost original device\nmanufacturer systems that are often re-branded. Also, alternative as-a-service providers are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery both to compete with traditional providers and to\noffer new routes to market for server and storage systems. These alternative providers include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM's own cloud-based services. The\ncompany gains advantage and differentiation through investments in higher value capabilities\u2014from semiconductor through software stack innovation\u2014that\nincrease efficiency, lower cost and improve performance. The company's research and development capabilities and intellectual property patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment's\nleadership across areas as diverse as high performance computing, virtualization technologies, software optimization, power management, security, multi-operating system capabilities and open\ntechnologies like interconnect standards to be leveraged by broad ecosystems. 9 Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remarketing of used equipment. Global Financing's\naccess to capital and its ability to manage increased exposures generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience,\nclient service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in\nproviding financial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of IT companies such as Cisco and HPE, non-captive financing entities and banks or\nfinancial institutions. In remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market.

He was with Boston Consulting Group for 26 years and he\nfocused on serving technology companies in the computing and communications sectors. Item\u00a01A. Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets could impact the Company's\nBusiness: If overall demand for IBM's products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue\nand profit could be impacted. The Company may not meet its Growth and Productivity Objectives under its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by transforming and globally integrating its own business\nprocesses, functions and technologies to remain competitive and to enable scaling of resources and offerings in both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield\ntheir intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives could impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving away from certain segments of the\nIT industry and into areas in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue\nits cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the\ncompany could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. Damage to IBM's Reputation Could Impact the Company's Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and\noverall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive\nleader. IBM's reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures,\ncybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture\npartners. If the 11 company's\nbrand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities could impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in its\nstrategic imperatives to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing\nsegments, and new delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. In addition, as the company expands to capture emerging growth opportunities, it\nneeds to rapidly secure the appropriate mix of trained, skilled and experienced employees, and develop ecosystems and collaborative partnerships. In emerging growth countries, the developing nature\npresents potential political, social, legal and economic risks from evolving governmental policy, inadequate infrastructure, creditworthiness of customers and business partners, labor disruption and\ncorruption, which could impact the company's ability to meet its growth objectives and to deliver to its clients around the world. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio may not prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM may not be able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any\nassurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter\nmisappropriation or improper use of the company's technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including\nnon-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual\nproperty could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations could impact the Company's Business: In the current environment there are numerous and evolving\nrisks to cybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers\nand others routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, and other third parties to disclose information or\nunwittingly provide access to systems or data. The risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers,\ncontractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. The company's products, services and systems may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, or involve the\nstorage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable\nintellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. Successful breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or\ntechnological error could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of\nsensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other\nmeans; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential\nliability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the\ncost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant. The company also experiences and responds to cybersecurity threats. To date,\nthere has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future. As the\ncompany's business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve, the company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. In the company's industry,\nsecurity vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered and 12 publicized\nacross a broad range of hardware and software products, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the\nfast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that\ncertain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company and its customers. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers will also depend\non factors such as actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions\nto or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or\nservices, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a\nrange of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. As\na global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and may have impacts on the company's\nbusiness, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. As the company's business focus on data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the\ncompany's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. The General Data Protection Regulation that will come into force in the European Union in May 2018 will continue to cause the company to\nincur additional compliance costs. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of new products and services, our ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of\ntechnology purchases. Moreover, the company's strategic imperatives involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of\npredicting the company's financial results. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for\nexample, certain of the company's services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result\nof the above-mentioned factors, the company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth\nquarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to\npredict. Due to the Company's Global Presence, its Business and Operations could be impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health\nConditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the\nUnited States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's\noverall results of operations. The company's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions,\ninflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base\nand the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements,\nlabor relations laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness,\npandemic or other local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand and\nthe company's operations and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. 13 The Company could incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign\nlaws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial\ncosts, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental\nlaws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters could impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the\nUnited States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to,\nincome before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower\nstatutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations,\naccounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation\nand Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain\nparts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to\nreview and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States\nInternal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of\nits provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition could be negatively impacted by its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse\nfinancial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a\nresult, the company's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide\nincremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by\npremiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at\nissue. IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective\ninternal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal\ncontrols, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could\nbe harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates involves Judgment and could impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of generally\naccepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported 14 financial\ncondition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In\naddition, as discussed in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal\nproceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and could be impacted by the loss of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company\ncompetes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a loss of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition,\nas global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a\ntotal compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity\nawards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business could be impacted by its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, and\nwith the completion of GLOBALFOUNDRIES' acquisition of IBM's global commercial semiconductor business in 2015, it became IBM's exclusive server processor technology provider for certain\nsemiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the\nfailure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations\ncould adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the\ncompany's products and services and harm the company's reputation. Product Quality Issues could impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and\nprocesses intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by\ncustomers or in the company's operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. The Company could be impacted by its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal\nGovernment and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public\nsector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses.\nIn addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company's results of\noperations and financial results. The Company is exposed to Currency and Financing Risks that could impact its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant\npercentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S.\ndollar. Further, inherent in the company's financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on 15 the\nassociated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks,\nincluding the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its\ncurrency and financing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance could be impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on\nReceivables: The company's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its\naccess to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The\ncompany's client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or, if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems could impact its Business: The company offers its products\ndirectly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem\npartners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable\nto keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be\nunable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable\nlaws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, and the Assumption of\nLiabilities: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Acquisitions and alliances present significant challenges and risks\nrelating to the integration of the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully or that strategic acquisition\nopportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives and anticipated revenue improvements and\ncost savings, as well as the failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the acquired\nbusiness. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to\nrisks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not\nsubject to the company's control. The Company is Subject to Legal Proceedings Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175\ncountries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary\ncourse of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2017 Annual Report to Stockholders.\nThe company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal 16 proceedings\nand other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time\nto time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A.\nentitled \"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: The company's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December\u00a031, 2017, in aggregate, the company\nowns or leases facilities for current use consisting of approximately 78 million square feet worldwide. At\nDecember\u00a031, 2017, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of 9\u00a0million square feet, of which 7\u00a0million was\nowned and 2\u00a0million was leased. Similar facilities in 15 other countries totaled 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 3\u00a0million was owned and 3\u00a0million was leased. The company's\nfacilities are utilized for current operations of all its segments. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains, divestitures and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance\nand upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"1999 Plan\"); the 1999 Plan is also\nused to fund awards for employees other than senior executives, Otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the\nplan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards). 21 The\n2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the \"Committee\"), and that Committee may delegate to officers of\nthe company certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not\ntransferable or assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii) as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the\nCommittee. If\nthe employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled\nimmediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits\nunder the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant's estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may be, shall\nhave the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or\notherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or\ndeferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant\nengages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company. PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan The IBM PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \"PWCC Plan\") was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with\nthe company's acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\"PwCC\") from PricewaterhouseCoopers\u00a0LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be\nused solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC\nPlan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan The IBM Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \"DCEAP\") was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective\nJanuary\u00a01, 2014.

PART I Item 1. Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the\nComputing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM\nhas focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90 years ago, in 1924, when\nC-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today\u2014the company creates value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that\nleverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create\nvalue by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading\nportfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the world's leading research\norganizations. IBM Strategy IBM's strategy is wholly focused on the needs of its clients. IBM is a technology company, but first and foremost it is an enterprise company.\nIBM serves enterprises of all sizes, and IBM's longest-standing clients are leaders in their industries\u2014the world's leading financial services institutions, airlines, manufacturers,\nconsumer goods and retail companies. IBM's mission is to help its clients transform their companies and lead in their industries. One\nof the biggest priorities for IBM clients is to derive competitive advantage through insights and the latest digital technologies. Better insight about the wants and needs of their\ncustomers will help them distinguish themselves in the marketplace. Data-driven insight will also influence how they design and produce their own products, as well as help them identify opportunities\nin new markets. However,\nmost companies are harnessing only a small percent of the valuable data they collect. As IBM clients embark on the next chapter of their digital journey, the proper collection,\nuse, safeguarding and management of data is of paramount importance. Choosing the right digital technologies to analyze the data is also necessary. IBM\nhelps clients harness the power of their data through technologies like AI, analytics and blockchain; on a hybrid cloud that connects data across traditional and new environments;\nwith services that put a client's data and insight to use in and for their business. Underpinning all of this, IBM safeguards client data with world-class technologies and approaches to security. By\nreinventing themselves digitally around insight, clients become what IBM calls Cognitive Enterprises. What IBM Brings to Clients Businesses are choosing IBM because they want to partner with a company that can uniquely integrate three core capabilities: 1. They\nwant the most innovative technology , like AI, blockchain, cybersecurity and quantum delivered in a hybrid cloud\nenvironment. 2. They\nwant industry expertise \u2014from a partner that deeply understands their industry and can apply\ninnovation to their business processes to drive transformation and competitive advantage. 1 3. And,\nfinally, they want a total commitment to trust and security . Clients want to partner with a company that will\nprotect their valuable data and insights, and one that develops and deploys new innovations with a commitment to do so responsibly. IBM\nis unique in that it can integrate all three core capabilities for clients. Innovative Technology IBM has a long history of bringing innovative technology to the world. For 26\u00a0years, IBM has led the world in U.S. patents; six IBMers\nare Nobel Laureates; and IBM engineers have developed innumerable first-of-its-kind products and services. Current examples of IBM's innovative technology\ninclude: \u2022 Analytics and AI: IBM's long-standing leadership in managing and extracting insights from data starts with a portfolio of analytics and\ndatabase offerings. A few years ago, IBM brought AI into the mainstream with the Watson platform, which to date has been the foundation of many Enterprise AI implementations in production. Recently,\nIBM augmented its Watson platform with a set of AI tools that enable clients to trace the origins of the data their AI models use, explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has\nnot crept into results. These innovations are making AI more consumable by everyday users\u2014not just data scientists. \u2022 Security: Businesses built around data require an unparalleled level of data security. IBM is the leader in information security for\nenterprises\u2014with leadership in both security software and services. Security is embedded inside all of IBM's products and services. For example, IBM Z offers pervasive security by building\ndata encryption directly in its computing processor. In addition, IBM's Services businesses are world class in embedding security into the solutions they build and run for IBM clients. \u2022 Blockchain is an exciting technology that is just beginning to transform business processes. IBM's platform has been rated number one by\nleading analyst firms such as Juniper Research and Everest Group. Blockchain technology enables multiple parties to conduct business with each other on a single, unified distributed system,\neliminating the costly and time-consuming hand-offs of fragmented systems. IBM is deploying blockchain technology with clients to transform how global trade is transacted, how food safety is tracked\nand how supply chains are managed. \u2022 Cloud: Enterprise clients are in the very early stages of the move to cloud. IBM estimates that only 20\u00a0percent of workloads have moved\nto the cloud\u2014with work ahead for the remaining 80\u00a0percent. The first part was to move business workloads that exist as a layer over core processes. The hard part is ahead: moving\nthe mission-critical systems that run banking, retail, telecom and other industries. Some of these workloads will remain in traditional IT systems, some will move to a private cloud inside the safety\nof a client's firewall, others will move to public clouds, and some will surge between all of these. Wherever a workload may reside, it will need to share its data across environments. All of this\nrequires an approach that is open, highly interoperable between environments, and even interoperable between different public clouds. This is what IBM has long called hybrid cloud\u2014and this\ndescribes the solution for the 80\u00a0percent of the workloads that is to come. With in-depth experience across all three environments, IBM brings the strongest hybrid cloud solution to the market\nfor enterprises\u2014which will be strengthened through the acquisition of Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat). Industry Expertise Changing a business requires in-depth understanding of how a business works and how technology can make it work differently. 2 IBM\nbrings both industry expertise and innovative technology to clients through the IBM services and products businesses. This combination makes IBM unique and essential. A\nfew examples of this capability are highlighted below: \u2022 Global Business Services: the IBM GBS business is one of the world's largest professional services businesses. Its mission is to help clients\nalong the journey to becoming a Cognitive Enterprise. \u2022 Global Technology Services: the IBM GTS business runs some of the world's largest data centers\u2014and thereby some of the world's most\nmission-critical workflows and franchises. GTS helps clients along their journey to the hybrid cloud\u2014leveraging the best of their existing systems in the context of the regulatory,\nsecurity and workflow of their industry. \u2022 Industry and Domain-Specific Solutions: augmenting IBM's services businesses are software and solutions designed for specific industries and\ndomains. For example: Health:\nIBM has become a leader in applying advanced digital technologies to healthcare, including the application of AI and data analytics to the diagnosis and treatment of patients, bringing smart\ndecisions to Health Care payers, and helping Life Sciences companies develop innovative products and services. Financial\nServices: IBM is a leading provider in the Financial Services industry; with IBM's Promontory Financial Group, a leading advisor in Financial Regulation and Compliance, IBM offers an\nadvanced set of solutions for managing Risk and Compliance, a critical workflow in the Financial Services industry. Trust and Security Data and AI\u2014together, they are both the opportunity and the issue of current times. They can make the world a better, healthier and\nmore productive place; but only if businesses and consumers trust the companies putting data and AI to work. IBM\nis a 107-year old business\u2014and the reason it has been successful for so long is because it has earned the trust of its clients. IBM has not only followed guidelines\naround the responsible handling of data and the stewardship of new technology, but created them, published them, and invited others to adopt similar commitments. IBM's principles make clear\nthat: \u2022 The purpose of new technologies is to augment\u2014not replace\u2014human expertise; \u2022 Data and insights derived from AI belong to their owners and creators (not their IT partners); and, \u2022 New technologies must be transparent and explainable. There\nare many companies in the IT industry who bring technology products to the marketplace. Many bring technology services to the marketplace. A few companies do both, but no one can\ndo it as well as IBM when it comes to meeting the needs of clients. By bringing together technology and workflow, combining it with industry expertise, innovation and deployment, IBM helps clients and\nindustries truly transform themselves. This\nis what truly sets IBM apart. Business Model The company's business model is built to support two principal goals: helping enterprise clients to move from one era to the next by bringing\ntogether innovative technology and industry expertise, and providing long-term value to shareholders. The business model has been developed over time through 3 strategic\ninvestments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The\ncompany's global capabilities include services, software, systems, fundamental research and related financing. The broad mix of businesses and capabilities are combined to provide\nintegrated solutions and platforms to the company's clients.

Global Financing encompasses two primary businesses: financing, primarily conducted through IBM Credit\u00a0LLC (IBM Credit), and\nremanufacturing and remarketing. IBM Credit is a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM that accesses the capital markets directly. IBM Credit, through its financing solutions, facilitates IBM clients'\nacquisition of information technology systems, software and services in the areas where the company has expertise. The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are\ncritical to the end users' business operations. The company conducts a comprehensive credit evaluation of its clients prior to extending financing. As a captive financier, Global Financing has the\nbenefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated\nwith financing, credit and residual value, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also maintains a long-term partnership with the company's clients through various stages of the\nIT asset life cycle\u2014from initial purchase and technology upgrades to asset disposition decisions. 6 Global Financing Capabilities Client Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms up to seven years. Assets\nfinanced are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where the company has expertise. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Technology Services\u00a0& Cloud Platforms'\nlong-term client service contracts. All internal financing arrangements are at arm's-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial\nFinancing: short-term working capital financing to suppliers, distributors and resellers of IBM and Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) products and services. The OEM\nportion will begin winding down starting in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the calendar year. Commercial Financing also includes internal activity where Global Financing factors\na selected portion of the company's accounts receivable primarily for cash management purposes, at arm's-length rates. Remanufacturing\nand Remarketing: assets include used equipment returned from lease transactions, or used and surplus equipment acquired internally or externally. These assets may be\nrefurbished or\nupgraded, and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally or internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally\nremarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Systems and Technology Services\u00a0& Cloud Platforms. Systems may also sell the equipment that it\npurchases from Global Financing to external clients. IBM Worldwide Organizations The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM's delivery of value to its clients: \u2022 Global Markets \u2022 Research, Development and Intellectual Property Global Markets IBM has a global presence, operating in more than 175 countries with a broad-based geographic distribution of revenue. The company's Global\nMarkets organization manages IBM's global footprint, working closely with dedicated country-based operating units to serve clients locally. These country teams have client relationship managers who\nlead integrated teams of consultants, solution specialists and delivery professionals to enable clients' growth and innovation. By\ncomplementing local expertise with global experience and digital capabilities, IBM builds deep and broad-based client relationships. This local management focus fosters speed in\nsupporting clients, addressing new markets and making investments in emerging opportunities. The Global Markets organization serves clients with expertise in their industry as well as through the\nproducts and services that IBM and partners supply. IBM continues to expand its reach to new and existing clients through digital marketplaces, digital sales and local Business Partner resources. 7 Research, Development and Intellectual Property IBM's research and development (R&D) operations differentiate the company from its competitors. IBM annually invests approximately\n7\u00a0percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and the company's business units through global labs on near-term and\nmid-term innovations. It delivers many new technologies to IBM's portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work\nin artificial intelligence, quantum computing, blockchain, security, cloud, nanotechnology, silicon and post-silicon computing architectures and more\u2014applying these technologies across\nindustries including financial services, healthcare, blockchain and IoT. In\n2018, for the 26th\u00a0consecutive year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBM's 9,100 patents awarded in 2018 represent a diverse range of inventions in\nstrategic growth areas for the company, including more than 3,000 patents related to work in artificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and quantum computing. The\ncompany actively continues to seek IP protection for its innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage its IP leadership. Some of IBM's\ntechnological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of its business model, the\ncompany licenses certain of its intellectual property assets, which constitute high-value technology, but may be applicable in more\nmature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands the customer base. This generates IP income for the company both upon licensing, and with any ongoing\nroyalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While the company's various proprietary IP rights are important to its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent on\nany particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Competition The company is a globally-integrated enterprise, operating in more than 175 countries. The company participates in a highly competitive\nenvironment, where its competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities.

Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company's Business: If overall demand for IBM's products and\nsolutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company's revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives under Its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration\nInitiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, agile\nprocesses and changes to the way the company works, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company's globally integrated model across both emerging and\nmore established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company's competitiveness\nand its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving into areas, including those\nthat incorporate\nor utilize artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its\ninvestments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to\ncommercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit\nmargins. Damage to IBM's Reputation Could Impact the Company's Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and\noverall\nreputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader. IBM's\nreputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents,\ngovernment investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the company's brand\nimage is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers and talent could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company's Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key\nstrategic\nareas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments.\nAdditionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and\nrespond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, and emerging business models, IBM's costs may increase or the client demand for our products or services may decline. IBM's Intellectual Property Portfolio May Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The\ncompany's\npatents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company's, nor can there be any assurance that\nthe resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company's intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper\nuse of the company's technology. In addition, the 12 company\nmay be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain\nfrom third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company's ability to protect its intellectual property\ncould also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Certain\nof the Company's offerings incorporate open source software licensed without warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections. If the code is no longer maintained by\nthe relevant open source community, then it may be more difficult to make the necessary revisions to the software, including modifications to address security vulnerabilities, which could impact IBM's\nability to market its products, mitigate cybersecurity risks or fulfill its contractual obligations to customers. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company's Business: In the current environment there are numerous and evolving\nrisks to\ncybersecurity and privacy, including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, employee malfeasance, and human or technological error. Computer hackers and\nothers routinely attempt to breach the security of technology products, services and systems, and to fraudulently induce employees, customers, and other third parties to disclose information or\nunwittingly provide access to systems or data. The risk of such attacks to the company includes attempted breaches not only of our own products, services and systems, but also those of customers,\ncontractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. The company's products, services and systems, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on\nbehalf of its customers, may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, or involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual\nproperty, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services and systems are also used by customers in\nheavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks, breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological\nerror could result in, for example, unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft of sensitive,\nregulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, destructive attacks or other means; and\nbusiness delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to potential liability,\nlitigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and\noperational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. To date, while the company continues to monitor for, identify,\ninvestigate, respond to and remediate security incidents, including those associated with cybersecurity attacks, there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the\ncompany, though there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity attack that has a material adverse effect in the future. As the company's business and the cybersecurity landscape evolve,\nthe company may also find it necessary to make significant further investments to protect data and infrastructure. In the company's industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered,\npublicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its\ncustomers. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and\ninfrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company and its customers, and may not be detected or\nremediated for some time afterward, particularly if additional steps are required to implement remediation-related updates. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also\ndepends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in 13 disruptions\nto or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party\noperations or services, financial loss, injury to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate\ncybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. As\na global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and may have impacts on the company's\nbusiness, including increased risk, costs, and expanded compliance obligations. As the company's business focus on data grows, the potential impact of these vulnerabilities and regulations on the\ncompany's business, risks, and reputation may grow accordingly. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and an increased number of data protection laws around the globe could\ncontinue to result in increased compliance costs and risks as a result of (i)\u00a0increased regulatory enforcement of GDPR and other data protection rules and (ii)\u00a0the trend of shifting and\nsharing data processing responsibilities from companies having direct relationship with consumers to all companies in the data processing chain. Any additional costs and penalties associated with\nincreased compliance and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market. The Company's Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the\nintroduction of\nnew products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain\nof the company's growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company's financial\nresults. The company's financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers' businesses; for example, certain of the company's\nservices contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned factors,\nthe company's financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high\nvolume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. Due to the Company's Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political and Health Conditions: The\ncompany is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or\npolicies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company's business and the company's overall results of operations. The\ncompany's results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between\nthe U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both\nwithin the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, laws relating to\nanti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health\nissue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company's\noperations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. For example, the U.K. referendum to exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \"Brexit\", has\ncaused global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. The company is actively monitoring and planning for Brexit. 14 The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and\nforeign laws and\nregulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs,\nincluding cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws\nand regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, results of operations and competitive\nposition. Tax Matters Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both\nthe United\nStates and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income\nbefore taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax\nassets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company's results of operations and financial condition\nin future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As\ncountries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the\nOECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company's income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and\npotential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal\nRevenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its\nprovision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company's provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse\nfinancial\nmarket conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company's pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the\ncompany's financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension\nplan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. Further, the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory\npension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM's 2018\nAnnual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company's internal control over financial\nreporting may\nnot prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal\ncontrols can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls,\nincluding any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company's business and operating results could be harmed\nand the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company's Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company's Financial Results: The application of\naccounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) 15 requires\nthe company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company's most critical accounting estimates are\ndescribed in the Management Discussion in IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \"Critical Accounting Estimates.\" In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\"\nin IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of\njudgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the\ncompany depends on\nthe continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes\nare in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as\nglobal opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM's key employees receive a\ntotal compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company's use, and the value, of the company's equity\nawards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage or forcing the company to use more cash compensation. The Company's Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM's business employs a wide variety of\ncomponents, supplies,\nservices and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company's businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server\nprocessor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring\nproducts to market. Further, the failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all\napplicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company's business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce\nthe reliability of the company's products and services and harm the company's reputation. Product Quality Issues Could Impact the Company's Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards\nand processes\nintended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or\nin the company's operations there could be\nnegative consequences that could impact customers' business operations and harm the company's business's operating results. The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company's customers include numerous governmental entities\nwithin and\noutside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company's agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding\nreductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and\nproviding for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties,\nwhich could negatively impact the company's results of operations, financial results and reputation. The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant\npercentage of\nits revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar.\nFurther, inherent in the company's financing business 16 are\nrisks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the\nfinancing of assets other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of\nnon-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company's efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. The Company's Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The\ncompany's financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company's earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively\nimpacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company's liquidity position. The company's client base includes many\nworldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world's largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company's revenue\ncoming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company's sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients' financial conditions. If\nthe company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the\ncompany may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company's consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company's Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products\ndirectly and\nthrough a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners\ncould subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up\nwith changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors,\nresellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to\nbring products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt\nLevels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions, including the proposed Red Hat\nacquisition, present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to\nthe company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key\npersonnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. The\ncompany plans to fund the Red Hat transaction with a combination of cash and debt financing. Any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM's ability\nto access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition\nor attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks\nrelated to retained liabilities not subject to the company's control. The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with\nclients in more\nthan 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in\nthe ordinary course of its business. The risks 17 associated\nwith such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note\u00a0M, \"Contingencies and Commitments,\" in IBM's 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted\nappropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot\nbe predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from\ntime to time,\nwith a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company's debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating\nprincipal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of\ninterest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company's ability to\npay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled\n\"Risk Factors.\" There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The\ncompany also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of\nIBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \"Risk Factors,\" as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally,\ntrading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company's financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company's control. Since the market price of\nIBM's common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company's stock at attractive prices. In\naddition, changes by any rating agency to the company's outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company's debt and equity securities. The\ncompany does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. Item 2. Properties: The company's corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December\u00a031, 2018, in aggregate, the company\nowns or leases facilities for current use consisting of approximately 75 million square feet worldwide. At\nDecember\u00a031, 2018, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the United States had aggregate floor space of approximately 7\u00a0million square feet, of which\n4\u00a0million was owned and 3\u00a0million was leased. Outside the U.S., similar facilities totaled more than 6\u00a0million square feet, of which 3\u00a0million was owned and\n3\u00a0million was leased. The company's facilities are utilized for current operations of all its segments. Although\nimproved production techniques, productivity gains, divestitures and infrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor space, continuous maintenance\nand upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

BUSINESS:\n \n    IBM was incorporated in the State of New York on June 15, 1911, as the\nComputer-Tabulating-Recording Co.(C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale\nCo. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co., and The International Time Recording\nCo. of New York. In 1924, C-T-R adopted the name International Business Machines\nCorporation.\n \n    IBM is in the business of providing customer solutions through the use of\nadvanced information technology. The company operates primarily in a single\nindustry utilizing several segments that create value by offering a variety of\nsolutions that include, either singularly or in some combination, technologies,\nsystems, products, services, software and financing.\n \n    Organizationally, the company's major operations consist of three hardware\nsegments: Technology, Personal Systems and Server; a Global Services segment; a\nSoftware segment; a Global Financing segment and a series of Enterprise\nInvestments.\n \n    IBM offers its products through its global sales and distribution\norganization. The sales and distribution organization has both a geographic\nfocus (in the Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa, and Asia Pacific) and a\nspecialized and global industry focus. In addition, this organization includes a\nglobal sales and distribution organization devoted exclusively to small and\nmedium businesses. IBM also offers its products through a variety of third party\ndistributors and resellers.\n \n    While IBM's various proprietary intellectual property rights are important\nto its success, IBM believes its business as a whole is not materially dependent\nupon any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or\nlicenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents relating to its\nproducts. Licenses under patents owned by IBM have been and are being granted to\nothers under reasonable terms and conditions. IBM protects its intellectual\nproperty rights in a variety of ways. These protections may not prevent\ncompetitors from independently developing products and services similar to or\nduplicative of the company's nor can there be any assurance that these\nprotections will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the\ncompany's technology. There can also be no assurances that IBM will be able to\nobtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future.\n \n    IBM's businesses employ a wide variety of components, supplies and raw\nmaterials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. To date, the\ncompany has found that the components, supplies and raw materials necessary for\nthe manufacture, production and delivery of its products and services have been\navailable in the quantities required. Certain of the company's businesses may\nrely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although the company makes\nevery effort to assure the alternative sources are available if the need arises.\nThe failure of the company's suppliers to deliver components, supplies and raw\nmaterial in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect\nthe company's business.\n \n    IBM's revenues are affected by such factors as the introduction of new\nproducts, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology\npurchases. As a result, the company's results are difficult to predict and the\nseasonality of technology purchases have historically resulted in first quarter\nrevenues lower than revenues for the immediately preceding fourth quarter.\n \n    The value of unfilled orders is not a meaningful indicator of future\nrevenues due to the significant proportion of revenue from services, the volume\nof products delivered from shelf inventories, and the shortening of product\ndelivery schedules. Therefore, the company believes that backlog information is\nnot material to an understanding of its business.\n \n    The company operates in businesses that are subject to intense competitive\npressures. The company's businesses face a significant number of competitors,\nranging from Fortune 50 companies to an increasing number of relatively small,\nrapidly growing and highly specialized organizations. The company believes\n \n                                       2 that its combination of technology, performance, quality, reliability, price and\nthe breadth of products and service offerings are important competitive factors.\n \n    Intense competitive pressures could affect prices or demand for IBM's\nproducts and services, resulting in reduced profit margins and/or loss of market\nopportunity. Unlike many of its competitors, IBM has a portfolio of businesses\nand must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with\ncompanies that specialize in one or more of these product lines. As a result,\nIBM may not fund or invest in certain of its businesses to the same degree that\nits competitors do and these companies may have greater financial, technical and\nmarketing resources available to them than the businesses of IBM against which\nthey compete.\n \n    IBM operates in more than 150 countries worldwide and derives more than half\nof its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or\npolicies of the countries in which IBM operates could affect its business in\nthat country and its results of operations. IBM's results of operations could\nalso be affected by economic changes in those countries and by macroeconomic\nchanges, including recessions and inflation. For example, weakness in the Asian\nand Latin American economies has had an adverse impact on IBM's business in\n1998.\n \n    The following information is included in IBM's 1998 Annual Report to\nStockholders and is incorporated herein by reference:\n \n    Segment information and revenue by classes of\n      similar products or services--Pages 84 through 89.\n    Financial information by geographic areas--Page 89.\n    Amount spent during each of the last three years on research\n      and development activities--Page 78.\n    Financial information regarding environmental activities--Page 76.\n    The number of persons employed by the registrant--Page 62.\n    The management discussion overview--Page 54.\n \n    Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements: Certain statements contained in\nthis Annual Report may constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the\nmeaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"Reform Act\").\nThe company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, in materials delivered to stockholders\nand in press releases. In addition, the company's representatives may from time\nto time make oral forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide\ncurrent expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include\nany statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact.\nWords such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes, \"expects,\" \"estimates,\" \"intends,\"\n\"plans,\" \"projects,\" and similar expressions, may identify such forward-looking\nstatements. In accordance with the Reform Act, set forth below are cautionary\nstatements that accompany those forward-looking statements. Readers should\ncarefully review these cautionary statements as they identify certain important\nfactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the\nforward-looking statements and from historical trends. The following cautionary\nstatements are not exclusive and are in addition to other factors discussed\nelsewhere in this Annual Report, in the company's filings with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission or in materials incorporated herein or therein by\nreference.\n \n    New Products and the Pace of Technological Change: The company's results of\noperations depend upon the continued successful development and marketing of new\nand innovative products and services. The development of new products and\nservices requires significant capital investments by the company's various\nbusinesses and the success of these products and services depends on their\nacceptance by customers and business partners. Further, the company's businesses\nare characterized by rapid technological changes and corresponding shifts in\ncustomer demand, resulting in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life\ncycles and an increasing emphasis on being first to market with new products and\nservices.\n \n                                       3 There can be no assurance that the company will successfully introduce new\nproducts and services, that these products and services will be accepted by\ncustomers, or that the company's businesses will recoup or realize a return on\ntheir capital investments. In addition, from time to time the company may\nexperience difficulties or delays in the development, production or marketing of\nnew products and services.\n \n    Volatility of Stock Prices: The company's stock price is affected by a\nnumber of factors, including quarterly variations in results, the competitive\nlandscape, general economic and market conditions and estimates and projections\nby the investment community. As a result, like other technology companies, the\ncompany's stock price is subject to significant volatility.\n \n    Dependence on Key Personnel: Much of the future success of the company\ndepends on the continued service and availability of skilled personnel,\nincluding technical, marketing and staff positions. Experienced personnel in the\ninformation technology industry are in high demand and competition for their\ntalents is intense. There can be no assurance that the company will be able to\nsuccessfully retain and attract the key personnel it needs.\n \n    Currency and Customer Financing Risks: The company derives a significant\npercentage of its non-U.S. revenues from its affiliates operating in local\ncurrency environments and its results are affected by changes in the relative\nvalues of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the\ncompany's customer financing business are risks related to the concentration of\ncredit risk and the creditworthiness of the customer, interest rate and currency\nfluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of\nresidual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these\nrisks, including the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivatives\ninvolve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can\nbe no assurance that the company's efforts to manage these risks will be\nsuccessful.\n \n    Distribution Channels: The company offers its products directly and through\na variety of third party distributors and resellers. Changes in the financial or\nbusiness condition of these distributors and resellers could subject the company\nto losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market.\n \n    Acquisitions and Alliances: The company has made and expects to continue to\nmake acquisitions or enter into alliances from time to time. Acquisitions and\nalliances present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration\nof the business into the company, and there can be no assurances that the\ncompany will manage acquisitions and alliances successfully.\n \nITEM 2. PROPERTIES:\n \n    At December 31, 1998, IBM's manufacturing and development facilities in the\nUnited States had aggregate floor space of 41.7 million square feet, of which\n34.0 million were owned and 7.7 million were leased. Of these amounts, 3.1\nmillion square feet were vacant and 1.9 million square feet were being leased to\nnon-IBM businesses. Similar facilities in 17 other countries totaled 18.0\nmillion square feet, of which 13.7 million were owned and 4.3 million were\nleased. Of these amounts, .9 million square feet were vacant and .6 million\nsquare feet were being leased to non-IBM businesses.\n \n    Although improved production techniques, productivity gains, and\ninfrastructure reduction actions have resulted in reduced manufacturing floor\nspace, continuous upgrading of facilities is essential to maintain technological\nleadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand.

Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled over 90\u00a0years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today\u2014we create value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the world\u2019s leading research organizations. IBM Strategy IBM\u2019s strategy begins with our clients. IBM is distinguished as being first and foremost an Enterprise company, serving the world\u2019s leaders in their industries. Serving enterprises requires a distinct set of skills as our clients entrust us with building, integrating and running the world\u2019s mission-critical systems. These are systems that cannot fail, systems that require the highest levels of privacy and security. They are built with our software and on our systems, designed and managed by IBM services. For example, we manage approximately ninety percent of the credit card transactions and half of the world\u2019s wireless connections. We do this with an unparalleled commitment to our clients\u2019 data security. We are unique in bringing innovative technology and industry expertise on a foundation of trust and security as an integrated proposition to our clients. This integrated proposition allows us to deliver business impact that matters to our clients, impact that requires bringing together technologies such as hybrid cloud, data and AI insight with workflow and advanced industry skills. This integrated proposition helps our clients transform themselves from traditional businesses to what we call Cognitive Enterprises. Furthermore, as technology becomes more central for business, as well as in our personal lives, trust matters more than ever. For decades we have followed core principles grounded in commitments to trust and transparency that guide our responsible development and deployment of new technologies. These values ground our business decisions, inspire our employees, and sustain our client relationships. We have not only followed guidelines around the responsible handling of data and the stewardship of new technology, but created them, published them and invited others to adopt similar commitments. Our focus is not just on our direct client work, but extends to society at large, as we have been very active in areas such as education, sustainability and security. This is reinforced through a culture of inclusion and diversity. All of IBM treats this \u201cresponsible stewardship\u201d as core to our mission. A New Chapter in Technology 2019 ushered in Chapter 2 of our clients\u2019 digital journeys in which the two predominant technology forces of our day\u2014hybrid cloud and data/AI\u2014are moving from \u201cstart-up\u201d to \u201cproduction at scale\u201d. These two forces work together to help companies become what we call Cognitive Enterprises\u2014companies that are powered by innovation, agility and data-driven intelligent decision making. We describe below how IBM is leading the way in Chapter 2. 1 Table of Contents Hybrid Cloud Chapter 1 marked the early stages of cloud with the rise of public cloud. This stage was focused on new end-user applications, including applications that have allowed consumers to check their bank balances, access social media, make online purchases and receive online support. While movement to public cloud has been strong, only twenty percent of workloads have been addressed in Chapter 1. Clients are merely at the beginning of a multi-stage journey. Chapter 2 is about clients modernizing the remaining eighty percent of workloads, moving mission-critical workloads to the cloud and infusing AI deep into the decision-making of their businesses. These mission-critical workloads include core financial transaction systems, customer databases and Enterprise Resource Planning systems. Some of these workloads will gravitate to the public cloud in Chapter 2, while others will move to a private cloud or remain in traditional IT environments for security, compliance and/or performance reasons. Wherever clients\u2019 workloads reside, these environments must work together seamlessly to communicate, share data and share capacity. With enterprises having accumulated as many as fifteen public clouds, each with its own means of management, harmonizing these different clouds has become a necessity. Bringing these multiple public clouds, private cloud and traditional IT together is what we call hybrid cloud. Hybrid cloud defines the mission for Chapter 2 in IT. We are a leader in hybrid cloud, and our mission in Chapter 2 is to bring our expertise and experience in building and managing mission-critical systems to lead our enterprise clients along this multi-stage journey. Our public cloud is built on a foundation of open source software and enterprise grade infrastructure. It is the most open and secure public cloud, and it is built for the enterprise with Cloud Paks\u2014enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions for applications, automation, data, integration and multi-cloud management. To accelerate our clients\u2019 success, we acquired Red Hat in 2019, further strengthening our leadership in hybrid cloud. Red Hat is the world\u2019s leader in open source technology, including Enterprise Linux, the operating system of the cloud, as well as containers and OpenShift, technology platforms that create seamless integration between traditional and cloud environments. As the leader in open source, Red Hat brings capability that enables applications to be \u201cwritten once and run anywhere\u201d, in turn helping companies avoid lock-in to a single cloud provider, thereby taking advantage of the entire industry\u2019s innovation. These technologies are central to the next era of computing. Our systems and services play a large role in these hybrid cloud offerings as well. We have introduced new versions of our systems that work securely and seamlessly in the hybrid cloud, bringing mission-critical workloads into our clients\u2019 digital journeys. Through our services, we play a large role in helping our clients map out their digital journeys, and then helping them build, manage and run the technology and the workflows. This integrated value proposition of innovative technology and industry expertise built on trust and security, and now together with Red Hat, is helping our clients realize the full potential and competitive advantage of the hybrid cloud. Data and AI A new era of business reinvention is emerging as leading companies are moving from merely improving their processes to creating truly \u201cintelligent workflows,\u201d processes that are not only efficient at what they do, but intrinsically smart : capable of finding, connecting and analyzing data to uncover deep insights that can inform intelligent decisions. Data and AI, in concert with hybrid cloud, are making intelligent workflows possible. We have been a pioneer of technologies and services that help clients collect, organize, and analyze their vast data stores and then operationalize AI across their business. Our long-running innovation in automation, data science, and natural language processing is helping clients manage their data as a strategic resource and deploy AI for greater insight and more accurate, trusted predictions. 2 Table of Contents Our data offerings help clients organize, collect, analyze and embed their data into their workflow. IBM software spans areas ranging from data management and discovery to reporting, governance, compliance and risk management. Our systems process our clients\u2019 data with unparalleled speed, accuracy and security and our services help clients capture and embed the value of their data into their business. Our IBM Watson AI system has been named by industry analysts as the worldwide market leader in AI for three consecutive years. Watson is not only a leading AI technology, but a leader in enterprise deployments in production and at scale. In addition to extracting deep insight from data, IBM Watson allows clients to trace the origins of the data that their AI models use, explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has not crept into results. Furthermore, IBM Watson is the only system that is built for the hybrid cloud, able to work on numerous public and private clouds. These innovations are making AI more consumable by everyday users, not just data scientists. Creating intelligent workflows relies on our integrated proposition of technology, services and industry expertise, built on a foundation of trust and security. The way in which we bring these together is through an interactive process with our clients that we call the IBM Garage, a process of deep collaboration, co-creation and innovation. * * * * * We are in an era when our clients are embedding technology into their businesses in ways they have never done before. Technology is no longer merely a \u201ctool\u201d, it is at the center of their businesses, the source of their competitive advantage and the force behind their emerging business models. In Chapter 2, IBM is bringing hybrid cloud and data/AI together to help our clients reinvent themselves as Cognitive Enterprises. The most challenging and complex work still lies ahead. With our strong commitment to responsible stewardship and our integrated value proposition, this makes us unique in helping our clients on their transformative digital journeys. Business Model Our business model is built to provide long-term value to stakeholders. We bring together innovative technology, industry expertise and a commitment to trust and transparency to help enterprise clients move from one era to the next. We provide integrated solutions and platforms, leveraging global capabilities that include services, software, systems, related financings and fundamental research. The business model has been developed over time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients. The business model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including our shift to cloud delivery models. We continue to strengthen our position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas, broadening our industry expertise and integrating AI into more of what we offer. In addition, we are transforming into a more agile enterprise to drive innovation and speed, as well as helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity. We also regularly evaluate our portfolio and investments, proactively bringing products to end of life, engaging in intellectual property (IP) partnerships and executing divestitures to optimize our portfolio. This business model, supported by our financial model, has enabled IBM to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term.

As a captive financier, Global Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated with financing, credit and residual value, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also maintains a long-term partnership with IBM\u2019s clients through various stages of the IT asset life cycle\u2014from initial purchase and technology upgrades to asset disposition decisions. Global Financing Capabilities Client Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms up to seven\u00a0years. Assets financed are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where we have expertise. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Global Technology Services\u2019 long-term client service contracts. All internal financing arrangements are at arm\u2019s-length rates and are based upon market conditions. Commercial Financing: short-term working capital financing to suppliers, distributors and resellers of IBM. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, we wound down the portion of our commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) IT suppliers, distributors and resellers. This wind down is consistent with IBM\u2019s capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. Commercial Financing also includes internal activity where Global Financing factors a selected portion of IBM\u2019s accounts receivable primarily for cash management purposes, at arm\u2019s-length rates. This program was suspended in the second quarter of 2019. Remanufacturing and Remarketing: assets include used equipment returned from lease transactions, or used and surplus equipment acquired internally or externally. These assets may be refurbished or upgraded, and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally and internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Global Technology Services. Systems may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients. IBM Worldwide Organizations The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM\u2019s delivery of value to its clients: \u25cf Global Markets \u25cf Research, Development and Intellectual Property Global Markets IBM operates in more than 175 countries with a broad distribution of revenue. To manage this global footprint, Global Markets leads our dedicated country-based IBM operations in order to serve clients, develop markets, and ultimately, ensure IBM is led through a client lens. These integrated teams serve our clients locally, complemented by digital capabilities, global talent and resources, and an extensive partner ecosystem. These country teams have client relationship managers at their center, who integrate teams of IBM consultants, solution specialists, delivery professionals and business partners on behalf of clients. Their mission is to provide insights and innovation and co-create with clients to help them address their most pressing business challenges and opportunities. In this way, we serve as a trusted partner to clients, establishing and maintaining relationships that deliver long- term value based on industry expertise, innovative technologies and an ability to deliver mission critical capabilities to an enterprise at scale. 6 Table of Contents Research, Development and Intellectual Property Our research and development (R&D) operations differentiate us from our competitors. In 2019, we invested approximately 8\u00a0percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and our business units through global labs on near- and mid-term innovations. It delivers many new technologies to our portfolio every\u00a0year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, security, cloud, systems and more\u2014applying these technologies across industries including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing and automotive. In 2019, for the 27th\u00a0consecutive\u00a0year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBM\u2019s 9,262 patents awarded in 2019 represent a diverse range of inventions in strategic growth areas for the company, including more than 4,500 patents related to work in artificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and quantum computing. We actively continue to seek IP protection for our innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage our IP leadership. Some of our technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of our business model, we license certain of our IP assets, which constitute high-value technology, but may be applicable in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands the customer base. This generates IP income for IBM both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While our various proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products. Competition IBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide. Our principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our broad range of capabilities, products and services; client relationships; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, a corporation must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. Over the last several\u00a0years, we have been making investments and shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into our offerings while building new solutions and modernizing our existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend our innovation leadership into the future. Our key differentiators are built around three pillars\u2013innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model. As we execute our strategy, we have entered into new markets, such as hybrid cloud, digital, analytics, AI, blockchain and quantum, and deployed new delivery models, including as-a-Service solutions, each of which expose us to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. A summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Cloud & Cognitive Software: The depth and breadth of our software offerings, coupled with our global markets, deep industry expertise and technical support infrastructure help differentiate our offerings from our competitors. IBM\u2019s research and development capabilities and IP patent portfolio also contribute to differentiation. The principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet\u00a0Inc. (Google), Amazon.com,\u00a0Inc. (Amazon), BMC, Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc. (Cisco), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce, SAP and VMware. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets. 7 Table of Contents Global Business Services and Global Technology Services: Our services segments, GBS and GTS, operate in a highly competitive and continually evolving global market. Competitive factors in these business segments include: quality of services, innovative offerings, financial value, technical skills and capabilities, industry knowledge and experience and speed of execution. Our competitive advantages in these businesses comes from our ability to design, implement, manage and support integrated solutions that address complex client needs across hybrid cloud environments. These solutions leverage automation, AI, extensive expertise in technology and innovation, services assets, and a strong set of relationships with clients and strategic business partners worldwide. Global Business Services: GBS competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services.

These alternative providers include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM\u2019s own cloud-based services. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher value capabilities\u2014from semiconductor through software stack innovation\u2014that increase efficiency, lower cost and improve performance. Our research and development capabilities and IP patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment\u2019s leadership across areas as diverse as high-end and high-performance computing, virtualization technologies, software optimization, power management, security and resiliency, multi-operating system capabilities and open technologies like interconnect standards to be leveraged by broad ecosystems. Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remanufacturing and remarketing of used equipment. Global Financing\u2019s access to capital and its ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing competes with three types of companies in providing financial services to IT customers: other captive financing entities of IT companies such as Cisco and HPE, non-captive financing entities and financial institutions. In remanufacturing and remarketing, the company competes with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market. 8 Table of Contents Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements Certain statements contained in this Form\u00a010-K may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cReform Act\u201d).

Risk Factors: Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: If overall demand for IBM\u2019s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company\u2019s revenue and profit could be impacted. The Company May\u00a0Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives under Its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, artificial intelligence, agile processes and changes to the way the company works, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company\u2019s globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company\u2019s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. Damage to IBM\u2019s Reputation Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry-leading technology and solutions and as a cognitive leader. IBM\u2019s reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the company\u2019s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers and talent could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM\u2019s costs may increase. IBM\u2019s Intellectual Property Portfolio May\u00a0Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May\u00a0Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company\u2019s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company\u2019s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company\u2019s technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Certain of the Company\u2019s offerings incorporate open source software licensed without warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections. If the code is no longer maintained by the relevant open source community, then it may be more difficult to make the necessary revisions to the software, including modifications to address security 10 Table of Contents vulnerabilities, which could impact IBM\u2019s ability to market its products, mitigate cybersecurity risks or fulfill its contractual obligations to customers. Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers, hacktivists, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies. Computer hackers and others routinely attempt to attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks. Such attacks may involve fraudulently inducing customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties. Cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time. The company\u2019s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, may be used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and may involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the company\u2019s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent an attack on the company or its customers, and may not be detected or remediated for some time afterward particularly if additional steps are required to implement remediation-related updates. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. To date, while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate security incidents, including those associated with cybersecurity attacks, there has not been a cybersecurity attack that has had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity attack that has a material adverse effect in the future. As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company\u2019s business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations. As the company\u2019s reliance on data grows, the potential impact of regulations on the company\u2019s business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of data protection and privacy laws and regulations around the globe, the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations, and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will continue to result in increased compliance costs and risks. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market. 11 Table of Contents The Company\u2019s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM\u2019s revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company\u2019s growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company\u2019s financial results. The company\u2019s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers\u2019 businesses; for example, certain of the company\u2019s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company\u2019s financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. Due to the Company\u2019s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty\u00a0percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company\u2019s business and the company\u2019s overall results of operations. The company\u2019s results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company\u2019s ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company\u2019s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. For example, the U.K. referendum to exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d, has caused global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. The company is actively monitoring and planning for Brexit. The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and competitive position. Tax Matters Could Impact the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company\u2019s income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States 12 Table of Contents Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. The Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company\u2019s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company\u2019s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company\u2019s financial flexibility. Further, the company\u2019s results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM\u2019s 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company\u2019s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company\u2019s Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company\u2019s most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM\u2019s 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates.\u201d In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0R, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company\u2019s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement. The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM\u2019s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company\u2019s use or the value of the company\u2019s equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage. The Company\u2019s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM\u2019s business employs a wide variety of components, supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company\u2019s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company\u2019s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely 13 Table of Contents manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company\u2019s business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company\u2019s products and services and harm the company\u2019s reputation. Product Quality Issues Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company\u2019s operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers\u2019 business operations and harm the company\u2019s business\u2019s operating results. The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company\u2019s customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company\u2019s agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company\u2019s results of operations, financial results and reputation. The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant\u00a0percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Further, inherent in the company\u2019s financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company\u2019s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. The Company\u2019s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company\u2019s financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide. The company\u2019s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM\u2019s 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company\u2019s liquidity position. The company\u2019s client base includes many worldwide enterprises, from small and medium businesses to the world\u2019s largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company\u2019s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients\u2019 financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company\u2019s consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. The Company\u2019s Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and 14 Table of Contents there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM\u2019s ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company\u2019s control. The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note\u00a0R, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company\u2019s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company\u2019s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item\u00a01A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company\u2019s financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control. Since the market price of IBM\u2019s common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company\u2019s stock at attractive prices. In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company\u2019s outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company\u2019s debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. \u200b Item\u00a01B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. \u200b Item\u00a02. Properties: IBM\u2019s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December\u00a031, 2019, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 75 million square feet worldwide, including 2 million square feet of leased space resulting from the acquisition of Red Hat on July 9, 2019. 15 Table of Contents At December\u00a031, 2019, IBM\u2019s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 26 million square feet, of which nearly 13\u00a0million was owned and over 13\u00a0million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled approximately 49\u00a0million square feet, of which 10\u00a0million was owned and 39\u00a0million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company\u2019s cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments. Continuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations. \u200b Item\u00a03.

The company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of closing. At December 31, 2019 there was approximately $2.0 billion in authorized funds remaining for purchases under this program. \u200b Item\u00a06.

(2) The numbers included for PSUs in column (a) above reflect the maximum number payout. Assuming target number payout, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of PSUs for equity compensation plans approved by security holders is 2,746,648 and for equity compensation plans not approved by security holders is 109,802. For additional information about PSUs, including payout calculations, refer to the information under \u2018\u2018 2019 Summary Compensation Table Narrative, \u2019\u2019 in IBM \u2019 s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April 28, 2020. The material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company. Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u2018\u20181999 Plan\u2019\u2019); the 1999 Plan is also used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards). 20 Table of Contents The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the \u2018\u2018Committee\u2019\u2019), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the Committee. If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant\u2019s estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company. PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201cPWCC Plan\u201d) The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\u2018\u2018PwCC\u2019\u2019) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \u201cDCEAP\u201d) The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January\u00a01, 2014. Under the Amended and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company\u2019s common stock. Upon a director\u2019s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company\u2019s stock either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director\u2019s distribution election.

Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June\u00a016, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100\u00a0years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today\u2014we create value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology and services capabilities support clients\u2019 digital transformations and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the world\u2019s leading research organizations. The following information is included in IBM\u2019s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference: IBM Strategy\u2014pages 23 to 25. Business Segments and Capabilities\u2014pages 25 to 28. IBM Worldwide Organizations\u2014page 28. Human Capital\u2014page 29. Competition IBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide. Our principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our broad range of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we must continue to invest, innovate and integrate. We are redefining our future as a hybrid cloud and AI company and have been making investments, both organic and inorganic, as well as shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into our offerings while building new solutions and modernizing our existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend our innovation leadership into the future. Our key differentiators are built around three pillars\u2013innovative technology, industry expertise and trust and security, uniquely delivered through an integrated model. As we execute our strategy as a hybrid cloud and AI company, deploy new delivery and go-to-market models and expand our ecosystem, we are regularly exposed to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. A summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Cloud & Cognitive Software: The depth and breadth of our software offerings, coupled with our global markets, deep industry expertise and technical support infrastructure help differentiate our offerings from our competitors. IBM\u2019s research and development capabilities and IP patent portfolio also contribute to differentiation. We have built a hybrid cloud platform based on open technologies that allows clients to realize their digital and AI transformations across the applications, data and 1 Table of Contents environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet\u00a0Inc. (Google), Amazon.com,\u00a0Inc. (Amazon), BMC, Broadcom, Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc. (Cisco), FireEye, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Salesforce, SAP, Splunk and VMware. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic or product markets. Global Business Services: GBS competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. We compete with broad-based competitors including: Accenture, Capgemini, DXC Technology (DXC), Fujitsu; cloud services providers; India-based service providers; the consulting practices of public accounting firms; and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Global Technology Services: GTS competes in project, managed and outsourcing services, cloud-delivered services, and technical and IT support services. The market contains a diverse set of competitors, with GTS the share leader. In Infrastructure & Cloud Services, our competitors include: Atos, DXC, Fujitsu, HCL, Infosys,Tata Consulting Services, Wipro and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. We also compete with the ecosystems of cloud platform vendors such as Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Oracle. In Technology Support Services, we compete with several hardware and software vendors who offer support services for their own products, as well as independent support services providers. Systems: The enterprise server and storage markets are characterized by competition in technology and service innovation focused on value, function, reliability, price and cost performance and as-a-Service delivery. Our principal competitors include Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel and original device manufacturer systems that are often re-branded. Also, alternative as-a-Service providers are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery both to compete with traditional providers and to offer new routes to market for server and storage systems. These alternative providers include Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM\u2019s own cloud-based services. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher value capabilities\u2014from semiconductor through software stack innovation\u2014that increase efficiency, lower cost and improve performance. Our research and development capabilities and IP patent portfolio contribute significantly to this segment\u2019s leadership across areas as diverse as high-end and high-performance computing, virtualization technologies, software optimization, power management, security and resiliency, multi-operating system capabilities and open technologies like interconnect standards to be leveraged by broad ecosystems. Global Financing: Global Financing provides client financing, commercial financing and participates in the remanufacturing and remarketing of used equipment. Global Financing\u2019s ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Global Financing primarily competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions. In remanufacturing and remarketing, we compete with local and regional brokers plus original manufacturers in the fragmented worldwide used IT equipment market. \u200b \u200b 2 Table of Contents Forward-looking and Cautionary Statements Certain statements contained in this Form\u00a010-K may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cReform Act\u201d).

Risk Factors: Risks Related to Our Business Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: If overall demand for IBM\u2019s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, or a shift in client buying patterns, the company\u2019s revenue and profit could be impacted. Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. Damage to IBM\u2019s Reputation Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. IBM\u2019s reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the company\u2019s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM\u2019s costs may increase. IBM\u2019s Intellectual Property Portfolio May\u00a0Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May\u00a0Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company\u2019s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company\u2019s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company\u2019s technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Certain of the company\u2019s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price. \u200b 4 Table of Contents The Announced Spin-Off of the Company\u2019s Managed Infrastructure Services Unit into a Standalone, Publicly-Traded Company is Contingent upon the Satisfaction of a Number of Conditions, May Not Be Completed on the Currently Contemplated Timeline, or at All, and May Not Achieve the Intended Benefits: On October 8, 2020, the company announced its intention to separate the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its Global Technology Services segment into a new, independent public company (currently referred to as NewCo). Completion of the announced spin-off, as well as the timing of completion, is subject to the readiness of NewCo to operate as an independent public company, finalization of the financial statements of NewCo, assurance that the separation will be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, finalization of the capital structure of the company and NewCo, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, final approval of the IBM Board of Directors, and other customary items. The announced spin-off is complex in nature and may be affected by unanticipated developments or changes in market conditions. There is the potential for business disruption and, as previously disclosed, the company expects significant separation costs. These or other unanticipated developments or costs could delay or prevent the announced spin-off or cause the announced spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated. Furthermore, if the spin-off is completed, there is no guarantee that it will be successful in meeting its objectives or achieving its intended benefits. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, including the company\u2019s intention to separate the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its Global Technology Services segment into a new and independent public company, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM\u2019s ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company\u2019s control. The Company\u2019s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM\u2019s revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company\u2019s growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company\u2019s financial results. The company\u2019s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers\u2019 businesses; for example, certain of the company\u2019s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the company\u2019s financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company\u2019s financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. Due to the Company\u2019s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions, including the COVID-19 Pandemic: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than fifty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company\u2019s business and the company\u2019s overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company\u2019s 5 Table of Contents results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company\u2019s ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company\u2019s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. For example, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. In the current macroeconomic environment, clients continue to balance short-term challenges and opportunities for transformation. Their short-term priorities continue to be focused on operational stability, flexibility and cash preservation, and as such, we may experience some disruptions in transactional performance. Additionally, clients\u2019 short-term priorities, as well as quarantines, limitations on travel and other factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delays in some services projects. Another example, the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U., commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d has caused global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. The company is actively monitoring and planning for possible impacts from Brexit. The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives under Its Internal Business Transformation and Global Integration Initiatives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, artificial intelligence, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company\u2019s globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company\u2019s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company\u2019s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company\u2019s Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition, including considering financial implications of the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM\u2019s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates.\u201d In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0R, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company\u2019s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement. 6 Table of Contents The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM\u2019s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company\u2019s use or the value of the company\u2019s equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage. The Company\u2019s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM\u2019s business employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company\u2019s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company\u2019s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company\u2019s business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company\u2019s products and services and harm the company\u2019s reputation. Product and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company\u2019s operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers\u2019 business operations and harm the company\u2019s business\u2019s operating results. The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company\u2019s customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company\u2019s agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company\u2019s results of operations, financial results and reputation. The Company\u2019s Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve growth objectives. In addition, the failure of third party distributors, resellers and ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers, hacktivists, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware 7 Table of Contents or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure. Attacks also include social engineering to fraudulently induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties. Cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time. The  company\u2019s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, including key innovations in artificial intelligence, blockchain, IoT, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the company\u2019s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors and other third parties. Cyber attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. To date, while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate cybersecurity incidents, there have not been cybersecurity incidents that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents that will have a material adverse effect in the future. As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company\u2019s business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of critical infrastructure, IoT devices, and various customer and government supply chain security programs. As the company\u2019s reliance on data grows, the potential impact of regulations on the company\u2019s business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of data protection and privacy laws and regulations around the globe, including an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms driven by the European Court of Justice decision in the Schrems II matter; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity; the potential for damages, fines and penalties; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will continue to result in increased compliance costs and risks. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market. \u200b 8 Table of Contents Risks Related to Laws and Regulations The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs for Environmental Matters: The company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and competitive position. Tax Matters Could Impact the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company\u2019s income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. \u200b The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note R, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. \u200b Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities \u200b The Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company\u2019s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company\u2019s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company\u2019s financial flexibility. Further, the company\u2019s results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM\u2019s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. \u200b The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, inherent in the company\u2019s financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client 9 Table of Contents creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company\u2019s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. \u200b The Company\u2019s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company\u2019s financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM\u2019s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company\u2019s liquidity position. The company\u2019s client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world\u2019s largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company\u2019s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients\u2019 financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company\u2019s consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. \u200b Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities \u200b Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company\u2019s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company\u2019s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. \u200b The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company\u2019s financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control. Since the market price of IBM\u2019s common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company\u2019s stock at attractive prices. \u200b In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company\u2019s outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company\u2019s debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. \u200b Item\u00a01B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. \u200b Item\u00a02. Properties: IBM\u2019s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December\u00a031, 2020, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 73 million square feet worldwide. At December\u00a031, 2020, IBM\u2019s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 25 million square feet, of which approximately 12\u00a0million was owned and 13\u00a0million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 10 Table of Contents 48\u00a0million square feet, of which 10\u00a0million was owned and 38 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company\u2019s cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments. Continuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations. \u200b Item\u00a03.

This table does not include shares tendered to satisfy the exercise price in connection with cashless exercises of employee stock options or shares tendered to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with employee equity awards. The company suspended its share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat closing in mid-2019. At December 31, 2020 there was approximately $2.0 billion in authorized funds remaining for purchases under this program. \u200b Item\u00a06.

The weighted-average exercise price of these awards was $43.88. The Company has not made, and will not make, any further grants or awards of equity securities under the plans of these acquired companies. (2) The numbers included for PSUs in column (a) above reflect the maximum number payout. Assuming target number payout, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of PSUs for equity compensation plans approved by security holders is 3,426,312 and for equity compensation plans not approved by security holders is 125,188. For additional information about PSUs, including payout calculations, refer to the information under \u2018\u2018 2020 Summary Compensation Table Narrative \u2019\u2019 in IBM \u2019 s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April 27, 2021. The material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company. Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u2018\u20181999 Plan\u2019\u2019); the 1999 Plan is also used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards). 15 Table of Contents The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the \u2018\u2018Committee\u2019\u2019), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the Committee. If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant\u2019s estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company. PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201cPWCC Plan\u201d) The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\u2018\u2018PwCC\u2019\u2019) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. IBM Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201cRed Hat Plan\u201d) The Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees who were not employed by IBM immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \u201cDCEAP\u201d) The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January\u00a01, 2014. Under the Amended and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company\u2019s common stock. Upon a director\u2019s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company\u2019s stock either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director\u2019s distribution election.

Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today\u2014we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients\u2019 digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world\u2019s leading research organizations. The following information is included in IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference: IBM Strategy\u2014pages 11 to 13. Business Segments and Capabilities\u2014pages 13 to 15. Human Capital\u2014pages 15 to 16. Competition IBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment, where our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Overall, across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide. Our principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our broad range of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we are optimizing our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations, shifting resources, embedding AI and cloud into our offerings while building new solutions and modernizing our existing platforms. These investments not only drive current performance, but will extend our innovation leadership into the future. We differentiate from other providers, as our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We leverage a flexible, secure, and open hybrid cloud platform and scale up solutions integrating (1) data, (2) AI for production and automation, (3) deep expertise in industries and business processes, (4) trust and security, along with (5) a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. All of these actions have positioned IBM for accelerated growth now with hybrid cloud and AI while preparing us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing. As we execute our strategy as a hybrid cloud and AI company, we are regularly exposed to new competitors. Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. A summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Software: The depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors. Our hybrid cloud platform based on open 1 Table of Contents technologies allows clients to realize their digital and AI transformations across the applications, data, and environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in this segment include Alphabet\u00a0Inc. (Google), Amazon.com,\u00a0Inc. (Amazon), BMC, Broadcom, Cisco Systems,\u00a0Inc. (Cisco), Informatica, Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Oracle Corporation (Oracle), Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, SAP, Splunk and VMware. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic regions or product segments. Consulting: Consulting has simplified our focus to center on strategy, experience, technology and operations to make our huge range of capabilities easier for clients to navigate. Today, Consulting competes in consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. We compete with broad-based competitors including: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Infrastructure: IBM is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions for clients\u2019 mission-critical and regulated workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of support services and solutions for hybrid cloud infrastructure. Our principal competitors include Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel and original device manufacturer systems that are often re-branded. Further, as-a-Service providers, such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to offer new routes to market for server and storage systems. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and regulated workloads. Financing: Financing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating IBM client\u2019s acquisition of IT systems, software and services. Financing\u2019s ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.

Risk Factors: Risks Related to Our Business Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: If overall demand for IBM\u2019s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions, including those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, or a shift in client buying patterns, the company\u2019s revenue and profit could be impacted. Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has been moving into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. Damage to IBM\u2019s Reputation Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. 3 Table of Contents IBM\u2019s reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the company\u2019s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM\u2019s costs may increase. IBM\u2019s Intellectual Property Portfolio May\u00a0Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May\u00a0Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company\u2019s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company\u2019s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company\u2019s technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Certain of the company\u2019s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM\u2019s ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company\u2019s control. The Company\u2019s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM\u2019s revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company\u2019s growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company\u2019s financial results. The company\u2019s financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers\u2019 businesses; for example, certain of the company\u2019s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, 4 Table of Contents including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the company\u2019s financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company\u2019s financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. Due to the Company\u2019s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions, including the COVID-19 Pandemic: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving more than sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company\u2019s business and the company\u2019s overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company\u2019s results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company\u2019s ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company\u2019s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. For example, on March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has created volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, artificial intelligence, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company\u2019s globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company\u2019s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company\u2019s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company\u2019s Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition, including considering financial implications of the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates.\u201d In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0S, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. 5 Table of Contents The Company\u2019s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement. The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM\u2019s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company\u2019s use or the value of the company\u2019s equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage. The Company\u2019s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM\u2019s business employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company\u2019s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company\u2019s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company\u2019s business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company\u2019s products and services and harm the company\u2019s reputation. Product and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company\u2019s operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers\u2019 business operations and harm the company\u2019s business\u2019s operating results. The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company\u2019s customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company\u2019s agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company\u2019s results of operations, financial results and reputation. The Company\u2019s Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. \u200b \u200b 6 Table of Contents Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers, hacktivists, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure. Attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. Cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time. The  company\u2019s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, including key innovations in artificial intelligence, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the company\u2019s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities with the potential for exploitation, and while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate such events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse effect in the future. As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company\u2019s business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of critical infrastructure, IoT devices, customer industries (e.g., financial services) and 7 Table of Contents various customer and government supply chain security programs. As the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company\u2019s business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of  cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms driven by the European Court of Justice decision in the Schrems II matter; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters: IBM, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and competitive position. Tax Matters Could Impact the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company\u2019s income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. \u200b The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note S, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b 8 Table of Contents Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities \u200b The Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company\u2019s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company\u2019s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company\u2019s financial flexibility. Further, the company\u2019s results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. \u200b The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, inherent in the company\u2019s financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities, the determination of residual values and the financing of assets other than traditional IT assets. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company\u2019s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. \u200b The Company\u2019s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company\u2019s financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity such as those associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The company\u2019s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM\u2019s 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company\u2019s liquidity position. The company\u2019s client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world\u2019s largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company\u2019s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients\u2019 financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company\u2019s consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. \u200b Risks Related to the Spin-Off of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. \u200b If the Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. Spin-off fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, it could result in substantial tax liability for the Company and its stockholders: In connection with the spin-off of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc., the company obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS and an opinion from its tax advisor, in each case to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The IRS private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. and the company regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, the conclusions reached in the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion could be jeopardized. If the spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the company\u2019s stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the company could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b 9 Table of Contents Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities \u200b Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company\u2019s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company\u2019s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. \u200b The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company\u2019s financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control. Since the market price of IBM\u2019s common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company\u2019s stock at attractive prices. \u200b In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company\u2019s outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company\u2019s debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. \u200b Item\u00a01B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. \u200b Item\u00a02. Properties: IBM\u2019s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December\u00a031, 2021, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 52 million square feet worldwide. At December\u00a031, 2021, IBM\u2019s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 20 million square feet, of which approximately 9\u00a0million was owned and 11\u00a0million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled nearly 32\u00a0million square feet, of which 7\u00a0million was owned and 25 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company\u2019s cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments. Continuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations. \u200b Item\u00a03.

The weighted-average exercise price of these awards was $25.92. The Company has not made, and will not make, any further grants or awards of equity securities under the plans of these acquired companies. (2) The numbers included for PSUs in column (a) above reflect the maximum number payout. Assuming target number payout, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of PSUs for equity compensation plans approved by security holders is 3,497,352 and for equity compensation plans not approved by security holders is 231,505. For additional information about PSUs, including payout calculations, refer to the information under \u2018\u2018 2021 Summary Compensation Table Narrative \u2019\u2019 in IBM \u2019 s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April 26, 2022. The material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company. Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u2018\u20181999 Plan\u2019\u2019); the 1999 Plan is also used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards). 14 Table of Contents The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the \u2018\u2018Committee\u2019\u2019), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the Committee. If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant\u2019s estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company. PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201cPWCC Plan\u201d) The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\u2018\u2018PwCC\u2019\u2019) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. IBM Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201cRed Hat Plan\u201d) The Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees who were not employed by IBM immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \u201cDCEAP\u201d) The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January\u00a01, 2014. Under the Amended and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company\u2019s common stock. Upon a director\u2019s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company\u2019s stock either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director\u2019s distribution election.

Business: International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) was incorporated in the State of New York on June 16, 1911, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co. (C-T-R), a consolidation of the Computing Scale Co. of America, the Tabulating Machine Co. and The International Time Recording Co. of New York. Since that time, IBM has focused on the intersection of business insight and technological innovation, and its operations and aims have been international in nature. This was signaled almost 100 years ago, in 1924, when C-T-R changed its name to International Business Machines Corporation. And it continues today\u2014we create sustained value for clients by helping them leverage the power of hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence (AI). Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology support clients\u2019 digital transformations and helps them reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. Our offerings draw from leading IBM capabilities in software, consulting services capability to deliver business outcomes, and deep incumbency in mission-critical infrastructure, all bolstered by one of the world\u2019s leading research organizations. The following information is included in IBM\u2019s 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders and is incorporated by reference: IBM Strategy\u2014pages 11 to 13. Business Segments and Capabilities\u2014pages 14 to 15. Human Capital\u2014pages 15 to 16. Strategic Partnerships We proactively partner with a broad variety of companies including hyperscalers, service providers, global system integrators, and software and hardware vendors. We work alongside our partners to deliver end-to-end solutions that address our clients\u2019 complex business challenges while accelerating growth. Our strategic partners include: Adobe, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Cisco Systems, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics and SAP, among others. Companies with which we have strategic partnerships in some areas may be competitors in other areas. Competition IBM is a globally integrated enterprise that participates in a highly competitive environment. Our competitors vary by industry segment, and range from large multinational enterprises to smaller, more narrowly focused entities. Across our business segments, we recognize hundreds of competitors worldwide and as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we are regularly exposed to new competitors. Our principal methods of competition are: technology innovation; performance; price; quality; brand; our breadth of capabilities, products and services; talent; client relationships and trust; the ability to deliver business value to clients; and service and support. In order to maintain leadership, we optimize our portfolio with organic and inorganic innovations and effective resource allocation. These investments not only drive current performance but will extend our innovation leadership into the future. Our breadth and depth of expertise enables us to take different technologies and bring them together to solve the most pressing business issues of our clients. We differentiate from other providers by bringing together incumbency with enterprises, deep expertise in technology, industries and business processes, a broad go-to-market reach including an ecosystem of partners and alliances, and a strong focus on innovation. All of these attributes position IBM for accelerated growth now and prepare us for the next set of business opportunities, such as quantum computing. 1 Table of Contents Overall, the company is the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. A summary of the competitive environment for each business segment is included below: Software: The depth, breadth, and innovation of our software offerings, coupled with our global reach, deep industry expertise and research capabilities help differentiate our offerings from our competitors. Our hybrid cloud platform based on open technologies allows clients to realize their digital and AI transformations across the applications, data, and environments in which they operate. The principal competitors in this segment include: Alphabet\u00a0(Google), Amazon, BMC, Broadcom, Cisco Systems, Informatica, Microsoft, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, SAP, Splunk and VMware. We also compete with smaller, niche competitors in specific geographic regions or product segments. Consulting: Consulting focuses on integrating skills on strategy, experience, technology and operations by domain and industry. Consulting competes in a dynamic market including consulting, systems integration, application management and business process outsourcing services. Our broad-based competitors include: Accenture, Capgemini, India-based service providers, management consulting firms, the consulting practices of public accounting firms, engineering service providers, and many companies that primarily focus on local markets or niche service areas. Infrastructure: IBM is well positioned in the growing hybrid cloud infrastructure market, providing on-premises and cloud-based server and storage solutions. We gain advantage and differentiation through investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and regulated workloads. In addition, we offer a portfolio of life-cycle services for hybrid cloud infrastructure deployment. Our principal competitors include: Dell Technologies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Intel, NetApp and Pure Storage as well as original device manufacturers (ODMs) who provide systems that are re-branded. Further, cloud service providers are leveraging innovation in technology and service delivery to compete with traditional providers and to offer new routes to market for server and storage systems. Financing: Financing provides client and commercial financing, facilitating IBM clients\u2019 acquisition of IT systems, software and services. Financing\u2019s ability to manage credit and residual value risk generates a competitive advantage for the company. The key competitive factors include: interest rates charged, IT product experience, client service, contract flexibility, ease of doing business, global capabilities and residual values. In client and commercial financing, Financing primarily competes with non-captive financing entities and financial institutions.

Risk Factors: Risks Related to Our Business Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: If overall demand for IBM\u2019s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions, or a shift in client buying patterns, the company\u2019s revenue and profit could be impacted. Failure of Innovation Initiatives Could Impact the Long-Term Success of the Company: IBM has moved into areas, including those that incorporate or utilize hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, quantum and other disruptive technologies, in which it can differentiate itself through responsible innovation, by leveraging its investments in R&D and attracting a successful developer ecosystem. If IBM is unable to continue its cutting-edge innovation in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving environment or is unable to commercialize such innovations, expand and scale them with sufficient speed and versatility or is unable to attract a successful developer ecosystem, the company could fail in its ongoing efforts to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins. 3 Table of Contents Damage to IBM\u2019s Reputation Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: IBM has one of the strongest brand names in the world, and its brand and overall reputation could be negatively impacted by many factors, including if the company does not continue to be recognized for its industry leading technology and solutions and as a hybrid cloud and AI leader. IBM\u2019s reputation is potentially susceptible to damage by events such as significant disputes with clients, product defects, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, cybersecurity incidents, government investigations or legal proceedings or actions of current or former clients, directors, employees, competitors, vendors, alliance partners or joint venture partners. If the company\u2019s brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers, talent and ecosystem partners could be impacted. Risks from Investing in Growth Opportunities Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: The company continues to invest significantly in key strategic areas to drive revenue growth and market share gains. Client adoption rates and viable economic models are less certain in the high-value, highly competitive, and rapidly-growing segments. Additionally, emerging business and delivery models may unfavorably impact demand and profitability for our other products or services. If the company does not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, disruptive technologies, emerging business models and ecosystems, the client demand for our products or services may decline or IBM\u2019s costs may increase. IBM\u2019s Intellectual Property Portfolio May\u00a0Not Prevent Competitive Offerings, and IBM May\u00a0Not Be Able to Obtain Necessary Licenses: The company\u2019s patents and other intellectual property may not prevent competitors from independently developing products and services similar to or duplicative to the company\u2019s, nor can there be any assurance that the resources invested by the company to protect its intellectual property will be sufficient or that the company\u2019s intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of the company\u2019s technology. In addition, the company may be the target of aggressive and opportunistic enforcement of patents by third parties, including non-practicing entities. Also, there can be no assurances that IBM will be able to obtain from third parties the licenses it needs in the future. The company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property could also be impacted by a lack of effective legal protections as well as changes to existing laws, legal principles and regulations governing intellectual property, including the ownership and protection of patents. Certain of the company\u2019s offerings incorporate or utilize open source and other third-party software licensed with limited or no warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections for IBM. Further, if open source code that IBM utilizes is no longer maintained, developed or enhanced by the relevant community of independent open source software programmers, most of whom we do not employ, we may be unable to develop new technologies, adequately enhance our existing technologies or meet customer requirements for innovation, quality and price. Risks to the Company from Acquisitions, Alliances and Dispositions Include Integration Challenges, Failure to Achieve Objectives, the Assumption of Liabilities and Higher Debt Levels: The company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions, alliances and dispositions. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks and there can be no assurances that the company will manage such transactions successfully or that strategic opportunities will be available to the company on acceptable terms or at all. The related risks include the company failing to achieve strategic objectives, anticipated revenue improvements and cost savings, the failure to retain key strategic relationships of acquired companies, the failure to retain key personnel and the assumption of liabilities related to litigation or other legal proceedings involving the businesses in such transactions, as well as the failure to close planned transactions. Such transactions may require the company to secure financing and any significant disruption or turmoil in the capital markets could have an adverse effect on IBM\u2019s ability to access the capital markets at favorable terms. From time to time, the company disposes or attempts to dispose of assets that are no longer central to its strategic objectives. Any such disposition or attempted disposition is subject to risks, including risks related to the terms and timing of such disposition, risks related to obtaining necessary governmental or regulatory approvals and risks related to retained liabilities not subject to the company\u2019s control. The Company\u2019s Financial Results for Particular Periods Are Difficult to Predict: IBM\u2019s revenues and profitability are affected by such factors as the introduction of new products and services, the ability to compete effectively in increasingly competitive marketplaces, the length of the sales cycles and the seasonality of technology purchases. In addition, certain of the company\u2019s growth areas involve new products, new customers, new and evolving competitors, and new markets, all of which contribute to the difficulty of predicting the company\u2019s financial results. The company\u2019s 4 Table of Contents financial results may also be impacted by the structure of products and services contracts and the nature of its customers\u2019 businesses; for example, certain of the company\u2019s services contracts with commercial customers in regulated industries are subject to periodic review by regulators with respect to controls and processes. Further, general economic conditions, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity may impact the company\u2019s financial results in any particular period. As a result of the above-mentioned factors, the company\u2019s financial results are difficult to predict. Historically, the company has had lower revenue in the first quarter than in the immediately preceding fourth quarter. In addition, the high volume of products typically ordered at the end of each quarter, especially at the end of the fourth quarter, make financial results for a given period difficult to predict. Due to the Company\u2019s Global Presence, Its Business and Operations Could Be Impacted by Local Legal, Economic, Political, Health and Other Conditions: The company is a globally integrated entity, operating in over 175 countries worldwide and deriving about sixty percent of its revenues from sales outside the United States. Changes in the laws or policies of the countries in which the company operates, or inadequate development or enforcement of such laws or policies, could affect the company\u2019s business and the company\u2019s overall results of operations. Further, the company may be impacted directly or indirectly by the development and enforcement of laws and regulations in the U.S. and globally that are specifically targeted at the technology industry. The company\u2019s results of operations also could be affected by economic and political changes in those countries and by macroeconomic changes, including recessions, inflation, currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies and adverse changes in trade relationships amongst those countries. Further, as the company expands its customer base and the scope of its offerings, both within the U.S. and globally, it may be impacted by additional regulatory or other risks, including, compliance with U.S. and foreign data privacy requirements, data localization requirements, labor relations laws, enforcement of IP protection laws, laws relating to anti-corruption, anti-competition regulations, and import, export and trade restrictions. Further, international trade disputes could create uncertainty. Tariffs and international trade sanctions resulting from these disputes could affect the company\u2019s ability to move goods and services across borders, or could impose added costs to those activities. Measures taken to date by the company to mitigate these impacts could be made less effective should trade sanctions or tariffs change. In addition, any widespread outbreak of an illness, pandemic or other local or global health issue, natural disasters, climate change impacts, or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, or any terrorist activities, could adversely affect customer demand, the company\u2019s operations and supply chain, and its ability to source and deliver products and services to its customers. The Company May Not Meet Its Growth and Productivity Objectives: On an ongoing basis, IBM seeks to drive greater agility, productivity, flexibility and cost savings by continuously transforming with the use of automation, artificial intelligence, agile processes and changes to the ways of working, while also enabling the scaling of resources, offerings and investments through the company\u2019s globally integrated model across both emerging and more established markets. These various initiatives may not yield their intended gains in speed, quality, productivity and enablement of rapid scaling, which may impact the company\u2019s competitiveness and its ability to meet its growth and productivity objectives. Ineffective Internal Controls Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If the company fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the company experiences difficulties in their implementation, the company\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed and the company could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations. The Company\u2019s Use of Accounting Estimates Involves Judgment and Could Impact the Company\u2019s Financial Results: The application of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires the company to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The company\u2019s most critical accounting estimates are described in the Management Discussion in IBM\u2019s 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders, under \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates.\u201d In addition, as discussed in note\u00a0R, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders, the company makes certain estimates including 5 Table of Contents decisions related to legal proceedings and reserves. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment. As a result, actual financial results may differ. The Company\u2019s Goodwill or Amortizable Intangible Assets May Become Impaired: The company acquires other companies, including the intangible assets of those companies. The company may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. If our goodwill or net intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to the Consolidated Income Statement. The Company Depends on Skilled Employees and Could Be Impacted by a Shortage of Critical Skills: Much of the future success of the company depends on the continued service, availability and integrity of skilled employees, including technical, marketing and staff resources. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where the company competes are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. Changing demographics and labor work force trends may result in a shortage of or insufficient knowledge and skills. In addition, as global opportunities and industry demand shifts, realignment, training and scaling of skilled resources may not be sufficiently rapid or successful. Further, many of IBM\u2019s key employees receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. Any new regulations, volatility in the stock market and other factors could diminish the company\u2019s use or the value of the company\u2019s equity awards, putting the company at a competitive disadvantage. The Company\u2019s Business Could Be Impacted by Its Relationships with Critical Suppliers: IBM\u2019s business employs a wide variety of components (hardware and software), supplies, services and raw materials from a substantial number of suppliers around the world. Certain of the company\u2019s businesses rely on a single or a limited number of suppliers, including for server processor technology for certain semiconductors. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these suppliers could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. Further, the failure of the company\u2019s suppliers to deliver components, supplies, services and raw materials in sufficient quantities, in a timely or secure manner, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect the company\u2019s business. In addition, any defective components, supplies or materials, or inadequate services received from suppliers could reduce the reliability of the company\u2019s products and services and harm the company\u2019s reputation. Product and Service Quality Issues Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business and Operating Results: The company has rigorous quality control standards and processes intended to prevent, detect and correct errors, malfunctions and other defects in its products and services. If errors, malfunctions, defects or disruptions in service are experienced by customers or in the company\u2019s operations there could be negative consequences that could impact customers\u2019 business operations and harm the company\u2019s business\u2019s operating results. The Company Could Be Impacted by Its Business with Government Clients: The company\u2019s customers include numerous governmental entities within and outside the U.S., including the U.S. Federal Government and state and local entities. Some of the company\u2019s agreements with these customers may be subject to periodic funding approval. Funding reductions or delays could adversely impact public sector demand for our products and services. Also, some agreements may contain provisions allowing the customer to terminate without cause and providing for higher liability limits for certain losses. In addition, the company could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor and could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, which could negatively impact the company\u2019s results of operations, financial results and reputation. The Company\u2019s Reliance on Third Party Distribution Channels and Ecosystems Could Impact Its Business: The company offers its products directly and through a variety of third party distributors, resellers, independent software vendors, independent service providers, and other ecosystem partners. Changes in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of these ecosystem partners could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring its products to market. As the company moves into new areas, ecosystem partners may be unable to keep up with changes in technology and offerings, and the company may be unable to recruit and enable appropriate partners to achieve anticipated ecosystem growth objectives. In addition, the failure of ecosystem partners to comply with all applicable laws and regulations may prevent the company from working with them and could subject the company to losses and affect its ability to bring products to market. 6 Table of Contents Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Cybersecurity and Privacy Considerations Could Impact the Company\u2019s Business: There are numerous and evolving risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including risks originating from intentional acts of criminal hackers, hacktivists, nation states and competitors; from intentional and unintentional acts of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties; and from errors in processes or technologies, as well as the risks associated with an increase in the number of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties working remotely. Computer hackers and others routinely attack the security of technology products, services, systems and networks using a wide variety of methods, including ransomware or other malicious software and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in hardware, software, and infrastructure. Attacks also include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. The company is at risk of security breaches not only of our own products, services, systems and networks, but also those of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties, particularly as all parties increasingly digitize their operations. Cyber threats are continually evolving, making it difficult to defend against such threats and vulnerabilities that can persist undetected over extended periods of time. The  company\u2019s products, services, systems and networks, including cloud-based systems and systems and technologies that the company maintains on behalf of its customers, are used in critical company, customer or third-party operations, and involve the storage, processing and transmission of sensitive data, including valuable intellectual property, other proprietary or confidential data, regulated data, and personal information of employees, customers and others. These products, services, systems and networks are also used by customers in heavily regulated industries, including those in the financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure and government sectors. Successful cybersecurity attacks or other security incidents could result in, for example, one or more of the following: unauthorized access to, disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, or destruction of company, customer, or other third party data or systems; theft or import or export of sensitive, regulated, or confidential data including personal information and intellectual property, including key innovations in artificial intelligence, quantum, or other disruptive technologies; the loss of access to critical data or systems through ransomware, crypto mining, destructive attacks or other means; and business delays, service or system disruptions or denials of service. In the event of such actions, the company, its customers and other third parties could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, including debarment, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In the company\u2019s industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for the company and its customers. In addition, the fast-paced, evolving, pervasive, and sophisticated nature of certain cyber threats and vulnerabilities, as well as the scale and complexity of the business and infrastructure, make it possible that certain threats or vulnerabilities will be undetected or unmitigated in time to prevent or minimize the impact of an attack on the company or its customers. Cybersecurity risk to the company and its customers also depends on factors such as the actions, practices and investments of customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, the open source community and other third parties, including, for example, providing and implementing patches to address vulnerabilities. Cybersecurity attacks or other catastrophic events resulting in disruptions to or failures in power, information technology, communication systems or other critical infrastructure could result in interruptions or delays to company, customer, or other third party operations or services, financial loss, injury or death to persons or property, potential liability, and damage to brand and reputation. Although the company continuously takes significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security. The company regularly addresses cybersecurity attacks and vulnerabilities with the potential for exploitation, and while the company continues to monitor for, identify, investigate, respond to and remediate such events, there have not been cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect on the company, though there is no assurance that there will not be cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that will have a material adverse effect in the future. As a global enterprise, the regulatory environment with regard to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection issues is increasingly complex and will continue to impact the company\u2019s business, including through increased risk, increased costs, and expanded or otherwise altered compliance obligations, including with respect to the increased regulatory activity around the security of critical infrastructure, IoT devices, customer industries (e.g., financial services) and 7 Table of Contents various customer and government supply chain security programs. As the reliance on data grows for the company and our clients, the potential impact of regulations on the company\u2019s business, risks, and reputation will grow accordingly. The enactment and expansion of cybersecurity, data protection and privacy laws, regulations and standards around the globe will continue to result in increased compliance costs, including due to an increased focus on international data transfer mechanisms and data location; increased cybersecurity requirements and reporting obligations; the lack of harmonization of such laws and regulations; the increase in associated litigation and enforcement activity by governments and private parties; the potential for damages, fines and penalties and debarment; and the potential regulation of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence. Any additional costs and penalties associated with increased compliance, enforcement, and risk reduction could make certain offerings less profitable or increase the difficulty of bringing certain offerings to market or maintaining certain offerings. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations The Company Could Incur Substantial Costs Related to Climate Change and Other Environmental Matters: IBM, like other companies, is subject to potential climate-related risks and costs such as those resulting from increased severe weather events, prolonged changes in temperature, new regulations affecting hardware products and data centers, carbon taxes, and increased environmental disclosures requested or required by clients, regulators and others. The company is also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to environmental protection, including the U.S. Superfund law. The company could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect climate change or compliance with environmental laws and regulations focused on climate change to have a disproportionate effect on the company or its financial position, results of operations and competitive position. Tax Matters Could Impact the Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition: The company is subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. IBM\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, income before taxes being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact the company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition in future periods. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is issuing guidelines that are different, in some respects, than long-standing international tax principles. As countries unilaterally amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact the company\u2019s income taxes. Local country, state, provincial or municipal taxation may also be subject to review and potential override by regional, federal, national or similar forms of government. In addition, IBM is subject to the continuous examination of its income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities around the world. The company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. \u200b The Company Is Subject to Legal Proceedings and Investigatory Risks: As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than 175 countries, IBM is or may become involved as a party and/or may be subject to a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and other proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The risks associated with such legal proceedings are described in more detail in note R, \u201cCommitments & Contingencies,\u201d in IBM\u2019s 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders. The company believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs. Legal and compliance risks, however, will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies, the outcome of which cannot be predicted with certainty, may arise from time to time. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b 8 Table of Contents Risks Related to Financing and Capital Markets Activities \u200b The Company\u2019s Results of Operations and Financial Condition Could Be Negatively Impacted by Its U.S. and non-U.S. Pension Plans: Adverse financial market conditions and volatility in the credit markets may have an unfavorable impact on the value of the company\u2019s pension trust assets and its future estimated pension liabilities. As a result, the company\u2019s financial results in any period could be negatively impacted. In addition, in a period of an extended financial market downturn, the company could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding with resulting liquidity risk which could negatively impact the company\u2019s financial flexibility. Further, the company\u2019s results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States. Premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. IBM\u2019s 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about potential impacts from pension funding and the use of certain assumptions regarding pension matters. \u200b The Company Is Exposed to Currency and Financing Risks That Could Impact Its Revenue and Business: The company derives a significant percentage of its revenues and costs from its affiliates operating in local currency environments, and those results are affected by changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar, as well as sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. Further, inherent in the company\u2019s financing business are risks related to the concentration of credit, client creditworthiness, interest rate and currency fluctuations on the associated debt and liabilities and the determination of residual values. The company employs a number of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivative financial instruments, which involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty. In addition, there can be no assurance that the company\u2019s efforts to manage its currency and financing risks will be successful. \u200b The Company\u2019s Financial Performance Could Be Impacted by Changes in Market Liquidity Conditions and by Customer Credit Risk on Receivables: The company\u2019s financial performance is exposed to a wide variety of industry sector dynamics worldwide, including sudden shifts in regional or global economic activity. The company\u2019s earnings and cash flows, as well as its access to funding, could be negatively impacted by changes in market liquidity conditions. IBM\u2019s 2022 Annual Report to Stockholders includes information about the company\u2019s liquidity position. The company\u2019s client base includes many enterprises worldwide, from small and medium businesses to the world\u2019s largest organizations and governments, with a significant portion of the company\u2019s revenue coming from global clients across many sectors. Most of the company\u2019s sales are on an open credit basis, and the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its clients\u2019 financial conditions. If the company becomes aware of information related to the creditworthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the company may have to adjust its allowance for credit losses, which could affect the company\u2019s consolidated net income in the period the adjustments are made. \u200b Risks Related to the Spin-Off of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. \u200b If the Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. Spin-off Fails to Qualify for Tax-free Treatment, It Could Result in Substantial Tax Liability for the Company and Its Stockholders: In connection with the spin-off of Kyndryl Holdings, Inc., the company obtained a private letter ruling from the IRS and an opinion from its tax advisor, in each case to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The IRS private letter ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Kyndryl Holdings, Inc. and the company regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, the conclusions reached in the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion could be jeopardized. If the spin-off is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the company\u2019s stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and the company could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. \u200b \u200b \u200b \u200b 9 Table of Contents Risks Related to Ownership of IBM Securities \u200b Risk Factors Related to IBM Securities: The company and its subsidiaries issue debt securities in the worldwide capital markets from time to time, with a variety of different maturities and in different currencies. The value of the company\u2019s debt securities fluctuates based on many factors, including the methods employed for calculating principal and interest, the maturity of the securities, the aggregate principal amount of securities outstanding, the redemption features for the securities, the level, direction and volatility of interest rates, changes in exchange rates, exchange controls, governmental and stock exchange regulations and other factors over which the company has little or no control. The company\u2019s ability to pay interest and repay the principal for its debt securities is dependent upon its ability to manage its business operations, as well as the other risks described under this Item 1A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d There can be no assurance that the company will be able to manage any of these risks successfully. \u200b The company also issues its common stock from time to time in connection with various compensation plans, contributions to its pension plan and certain acquisitions. The market price of IBM common stock is subject to significant volatility, due to other factors described under this Item 1A. entitled \u201cRisk Factors,\u201d as well as economic and geopolitical conditions generally, trading volumes, speculation by the press or investment community about the company\u2019s financial condition, and other factors, many of which are beyond the company\u2019s control. Since the market price of IBM\u2019s common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able to sell the company\u2019s stock at attractive prices. \u200b In addition, changes by any rating agency to the company\u2019s outlook or credit ratings can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both the company\u2019s debt and equity securities. The company does not make a market in either its debt or equity securities and cannot provide any assurances with respect to the liquidity or value of such securities. \u200b Item\u00a01B. Unresolved Staff Comments: Not applicable. \u200b Item\u00a02. Properties: IBM\u2019s corporate headquarters are located at an owned site in Armonk, New York. As of December\u00a031, 2022, in aggregate, we owned or leased facilities for current use consisting of approximately 47 million square feet worldwide. At December\u00a031, 2022, IBM\u2019s facilities in the U.S. had aggregate floor space of approximately 18 million square feet, of which approximately 9\u00a0million was owned and 9\u00a0million was leased. Outside the U.S., facilities totaled approximately 29\u00a0million square feet, of which 6 million was owned and 23 million was leased. This space is primarily used for sales and distribution, manufacturing and development, data processing services including the company\u2019s cloud centers, research and other administrative and general support purposes. Our facilities are utilized for current operations of all business segments. Continuous maintenance and upgrading of facilities are essential to maintain technological leadership, improve productivity and meet customer demand. We believe that in all material respects our properties have been satisfactorily maintained, are in good condition and are suitable for our operations. \u200b Item\u00a03.

The weighted-average exercise price of these awards was $19.77. The Company has not made, and will not make, any further grants or awards of equity securities under the plans of these acquired companies. (2) The numbers included for PSUs in column (a) above reflect the maximum number payout. Assuming target number payout, the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of PSUs for equity compensation plans approved by security holders is 3,244,703 and for equity compensation plans not approved by security holders is 321,375. For additional information about PSUs, including payout calculations, refer to the information under \u2018\u2018 2022 Summary Compensation Table and Related Narrative \u2019\u2019 in IBM \u2019 s definitive Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC and delivered to stockholders in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held April 25, 2023. The material features of each equity compensation plan under which equity securities are authorized for issuance that was adopted without stockholder approval are described below: 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201c2001 Plan\u201d) The 2001 Plan has been used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives of the Company. Awards for senior executives of the Company have been and will continue to be funded from the stockholder-approved 1999 Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u2018\u20181999 Plan\u2019\u2019); the 1999 Plan is also used to fund awards for employees other than senior executives, otherwise, the provisions of the 2001 Plan are identical to the 1999 Plan, including the type of awards that may be granted under the plan (stock options, restricted stock and unit awards and long-term performance incentive awards). 14 Table of Contents The 2001 Plan is administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the \u2018\u2018Committee\u2019\u2019), and that Committee may delegate to officers of the company certain of its duties, powers and authority. Payment of awards may be made in the form of cash, stock or combinations thereof and may be deferred with Committee approval. Awards are not transferable or assignable except (i)\u00a0by law, will or the laws of descent and distribution, (ii)\u00a0as a result of the disability of the recipient, or (iii)\u00a0with the approval of the Committee. If the employment of a participant terminates, other than as a result of the death or disability of a participant, all unexercised, deferred and unpaid awards shall be canceled immediately, unless the award agreement provides otherwise. In the event of the death of a participant or in the event a participant is deemed by the company to be disabled and eligible for benefits under the terms of the IBM Long-Term Disability Plan (or any successor plan or similar plan of another employer), the participant\u2019s estate, beneficiaries or representative, as the case may be, shall have the rights and duties of the participant under the applicable award agreement. In addition, unless the award agreement specifies otherwise, the Committee may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any unexpired, unpaid, or deferred award at any time if the participant is not in compliance with all applicable provisions of the awards agreement and the 2001 Plan. In addition, awards may be cancelled if the participant engages in any conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of the company. PWCC Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201cPWCC Plan\u201d) The PWCC Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting (\u2018\u2018PwCC\u2019\u2019) from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, as announced on October\u00a01, 2002. The PWCC Plan has been and will continue to be used solely to fund awards for employees of PwCC who have become employed by the company as a result of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the PWCC Plan. The terms and conditions of the PWCC Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. IBM Red Hat Acquisition Long-Term Performance Plan (the \u201cRed Hat Plan\u201d) The Red Hat Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors in connection with the company\u2019s acquisition of Red Hat, Inc. on July 9, 2019. The Red Hat Plan was used solely to fund awards for employees who were not employed by IBM immediately prior to the closing of the acquisition. Awards for senior executives of the company will not be funded from the Red Hat Plan. The terms and conditions of the Red Hat Plan are substantively identical to the terms and conditions of the 2001 Plan, described above. Amended and Restated Deferred Compensation and Equity Award Plan (the \u201cDCEAP\u201d) The DCEAP was adopted in 1993 and amended and restated effective January\u00a01, 2014. Under the Amended and Restated DCEAP, non-management directors receive Promised Fee Shares in connection with deferred annual retainer payments. Each Promised Fee Share is equal in value to one share of the company\u2019s common stock. Upon a director\u2019s retirement or other completion of service as a director, amounts deferred into Promised Fee Shares are payable in either cash and/or shares of the company\u2019s stock either as lump sum or installments pursuant to the director\u2019s distribution election.
