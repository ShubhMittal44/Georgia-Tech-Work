# Financial Services Innovation Lab, Georgia Tech [TASK] - RAG App for Interpreting SEC-EDGAR Findings :bar_chart:

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation application designed to interpret SEC-EDGAR findings efficiently. Using Large Language Models technologies, it extracts, processes, and analyzes financial documents to provide actionable insights.

**LOCAL DEMO OF APP :calling:** - 

## Tech Stack Used :page_facing_up:
- **Python**: The core programming language powering the application.
- **Gemini-pro API**: Interfaces with LLMs to implement RAG for insightful response generation.
- **Seaborn (sns) plots**: Enhances data visualization, providing clear, insightful charts.
- **Streamlit**: Simplifies application deployment and provides an interactive user interface.

## Workflow :page_facing_up:
1. **Data Extraction**: Extracts financial data from SEC-EDGAR documents.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Prepares the extracted data by cleaning and preprocessing.
3. **Integrating LLM API for RAG**: Interfaces with the Gemini-pro API to generate relevant responses.
4. **Response Generation**: Produces comprehensive responses to interpret SEC-EDGAR findings.
5. **Deploy**: Makes the application available for real-time use via Streamlit.
6. **Interpret and Visualize**: Presents data in a clear, easy-to-understand format using Seaborn.
